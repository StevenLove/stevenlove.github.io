# Overview
Inspired by project by Eliot Caroom
https://github.com/ecaroom/climbing-accidents/tree/master

# usage
run http-server to host the site locally or otherwise host it
go to index.html and view climbing accidents 
you can type some text that is used to filter the title
you can supply a query string argument like ?q=cat to filter the title by 'cat', so you can send a link to someone
items are shown in reverse chronological order so most recent stuff is at the top
it is recommended to search for the name of an area you want to climb so you can see what to look out for

# puppeteer
the puppeteer folder has a script (script.js) that you can run to scrape american alpine club's website for climbing accident reports.
