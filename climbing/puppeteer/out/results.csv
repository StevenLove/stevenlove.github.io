On 23 November a party of climbers from the University of North Carolina were practicing rock climbing technique at an abandoned rock quarry about one mile south of Durham. George Huppert (20) and Joseph McSwain started to climb an obvious crack up an inside corner using direct aid. Huppert, who was leading, had placed one piton and was placing another between the corner and the main cliff. The piton sounded good for the first two blows, but on the third, the piton went into the eye unexpectedly, acted as a wedge, and pried a huge block (which had been the inside corner) from the main cliff. All pitons came out, and both Huppert and the block tumbled fifteen feet to the ground. He was crushed when the block hit him.Several of the other members notified the Durham County Rescue Squad, while others tried to relieve the pressure of the rock against Huppert. The members of the Rescue Squad estimated the weight of the block to be around 3,000 pounds.Huppert was rushed to Watts Hospital in Durham. The doctors said that he suffered a dislocated pelvis, a fractured hip, and a severe laceration of the coccyx. He is now making a complete recovery.Source: George E. DeWolfe.Analysis: Huppert is an experienced climber and was using every safety precaution one can employ on a direct aid ascent. No procedures were violated. I think that a hard hat could have prevented any damage done to Huppert’s head, although there was next to none. It was a freak accident that could have happened to any of us, and I feel sure that Huppert feels lucky to be alive."

On December 3rd Steve Longenecker (age 33) and Robert Watts (27) were doing a short rock climb at Table Rock. Longenecker customarily climbed in a seat harness made of one-inch nylon webbing. Having forgotten his own, he borrowed one that Watts had worn on two previous outings. The webbing was approximately twelve feet long and had a piece of tape about midway. When Longenecker fell on the lead, the webbing parted at the tape, letting him drop 62 feet to the ground, where he landed on his left side, sustaining a broken rib, several bruised muscles, and a brain contusion. He was wearing a Joe Brown hard hat that was not scratched in the fall. (Source: Longenecker.)Analysis: Both leader and belayer assumed that the tape marked the middle of the webbing. Not so. The webbing consisted of two separate pieces that had been taped together before Watts purchased it. Manufacturers may splice webbing with tape so as to sell it in reels of exact length. Other climbers have purchased spliced webbing, including one who used it as a running belay sling. Obviously, climbing equipment shops should put an end to this custom. Climbers have an equal responsibility to inspect their gear closely, which means that no working length of rope or webbing should be covered with tape."

Treiber, an experienced climber, lost his balance before he was able to clip into his fifth piece of protection and began to fall. The rock where the fourth piece of protection was placed broke, causing the piece to come out. His first, second and third protection pieces remained but did not prevent him from hitting the base of the route. Additional reports suggest that he fell on the upper part of the first pitch well above his last piece of protection. When his last piece blew, it caused him to invert, striking the back of his head against the wall. A broken neck and concussion to the head were the major injuries. He was not wearing a helmet. CPR initiated by his partner was unsuccessfulExperienced climbers at the scene said that Treiber was using the appropriate equipment and it was in good working order. Over 40 personnel from Burke County Emergency Services, Burke County EMS Special Operations Team, Jonas Ridge Fire and First Responders, Burke County Rescue Squad, Lake James Fire Department, Oak Hill Fire Department, Burke County REACT, North Carolina Outward Bound School, and Linville Central Rescue were involved in the body recovery. (Sources: Sharon McBrayer, The News Herald, September 9, 2002, and Aram Attarian)AnalysisI went into the Gorge with knowledge of the accident but not sure where it happened. When I arrived at the base of Bumblebee Buttress, my whole day changed. I saw two pieces of gear still in place on the route, the first piece, a well-placed .75 Camalot. It was about 15 feet up. The second was a #8 Metolius cam. It was about 20 feet higher, right below the crux of the first pitch. Both were in good rock with long slings. I saw no fifth piece. I had planned on soloing the route, but only went up as far as the gear I could see from the ground—40 feet or so, not quite up into the corner system.On the first ledge at the base of the route I found a rope bag and a “mashed up” #4 Metolius cam. The cam looked as though it had been pulled through the crack. The trigger was pushed up against the cam head and the head itself was “chewed up.” With the stem slightly bent, it looked like it had taken a small amount of force before it popped. It was not in good working order. My guess is that it was the second piece to fail.In between the .75 and the #8 Metolius, I found a damaged .5 Camalot lying in the crack. The .5 showed signs of great stress. It looked as though it was placed horizontally. The cam head was slightly mashed on one side, but the stem was bent over like a piece of elbow macaroni. The cable was crushed and frayed, showing signs of significant force spread out over the entire stem. It looked as though it was placed on top of and behind a blocky feature. The sling of the cam was frayed on the clip in end and looked as though it had been melted with a hot iron on the side that would have been in contact with the rock.My guess is Colin lost his footing trying to clip his fifth piece and fell (possibly upside down) 20-25 feet onto the .5 Camalot. I’m not sure whether or not he collided with the rock before the placement failed or after, but given the amount of force the .5 Camalot looks to have taken, it suggests that it happened after, causing the rock around the placement to explode and fall down onto Colin. The #4 Metolius cam seems not to have held either, also due to rock quality. There was a significant amount scaring caused by rocks about the size of a soccer ball low on the route. Colin’s fall was then arrested by the #8 Metolius a few feet off the deck. All in all the fall was probably around 80-90 feet.With all this said, here is what I think we can learn from this tragic accident. Always wear a helmet while climbing in the Gorge, try to use passive protection as much as possible around hollow or questionable rock features, and be extremely cautious of ledge-fall potential.

The bat, who was in a crack that several other climbers used, was captured by the staff so the Health Department could determine whether or not the bat had rabies. (Source: Carrie Hozena, North Carolina Outward Bound School)AnalysisBats are occasionally on several of the climbing areas in North Carolina (and elsewhere). This is the first report of anyone being bitten, and the response to the accident should be remembered. The victim was spared the potential of serious illness. Even if the suspected critter cannot be found, a shot series should be considered. In this case, the bat, though found not to have rabies, was captured an hour after the incident (using gloves, snake stick, and a bag), so in case it might have been a different bat, the victim took a series of shots. They had no side effects, and she was able to complete her program. (Source: J. Williamson)"

The storm occurred just after 1400. Tiegdan was part of a group of climbers who sought shelter in what they thought was a protected area. The strike affected four climbers. At the time, Tiegdan was leaning against the rock face with a wet coil of rope looped over both shoulders. Despite an over two hour resuscitative effort, which included CPR, IV, oxygen, epinephrine, atropine sulfate and sodium bicarbonate, the victim died from electrical shock. (Source: from a report by Paul M. Weathers)AnalysisThe victim’s location was actually in a spark gap, under a ledge. The rope helped act as a conductor. While there may be no “good” location on a route, being out from under a ledge or shallow cave is a better choice. (Source:J.

Bates was a member of a party of three which had completed the ascent (possibly the first) of a 400-foot Scottish Grade V ice climb on the North Face of the Courthouse the previous day.The accident occurred while Bates, Truette Stubbs (39) of Atlanta, and I, Dave Buck (26), of Atlantic Beach, Florida, were collecting equipment left the previous day. In that there was gear to be retrieved from both the base and the top of the route, the party had split up, with Buck collecting the equipment left in the woods at the top, while Bates and Stubbs went to retrieve the remaining at the base.While Bates and Stubbs were on a large ice-covered ledge (about 15 feet wide by 35 feet long) from which the climb had been started, Bates was photographing the route from various angles. At one point he cramponed down a number of feet below the ledge on a 30-degree ice slope which formed the top of a long, low angle ice gully which extended over 200 feet below the ledge. While standing on the ice on the front points of his crampons he went to his knees, apparently to get a better photographic perspective, lost the grip of his front points, and slid down the gully for a distance of over 200 feet. As he first began to slide he seemed not to realize the danger he was in as he retained his grip on the camera, though he did make some efforts to regain his balance. As the speed of the slide increased, he let go of the camera and almost immediately thereafter his head struck an exposed rock, apparently rendering him unconscious. Even in the event that he had had an axe and had attempted to self-arrest, it seems highly unlikely that the attempt could have been successful due to the very hard surface of the ice and the many bulges and boulders in the bed of the gully. Although Stubbs cramponed down immediately to give any aid possible, Bates was dead when he reached him.The two surviving members of the team reported the accident to the authorities in Highlands, North Carolina, and later in the afternoon, I returned to the scene of the accident with members of the Glenville Cashiers Rescue Squad to recover the body. The recovery operation was completed by 9:30 p.m. (Source: David M. Buck)AnalysisAlthough I was not immediately present when the accident occurred, I have been told by Truette Stubbs, who witnessed it, that Jeff was very excited while they were at the base of the climb, very happy at having completed the best climb of his career. I know that we all realized the potential danger presented by the gully, having watched pieces of ice bound down it during our ascent of the frozen waterfall above the previous day, so I do not feel that Jeff, had he kept his mind fully on what he was doing, would have ventured into the gully unroped and without even an axe or helmet. Certainly under no circumstances would he have tried to brace his knees on the ice to get a photograph. Based upon what I know of Jeff’s knowledge and ability on ice, and what I have been told of the accident, the only judgment that I can draw is that in his excitement Jeff let his emotions overcome his thinking and made two basic yet tragic errors: he climbed, unroped and ill equipped, into a potentially dangerous position and then tried to brace his knees on a slope of pure water ice.The possibility that Jeff might have survived the fall had he been wearing a helmet, as we all did on the climb, must be considered. Whether or not it would indeed have saved him I cannot even guess as I do not know the extent of any internal injuries he sustained in the fall. It can certainly be said, however, that a helmet would have offered some protection at least.If there is a lesson to be learned from Jeff’s death, it is, I think, that none of us can allow our concentration to fail for even a fraction of a second while we are in the mountains. No matter how easy the terrain, how apparently safe the position, we must not allow our minds to wander from the job at hand; we must not let the emotions of the moment overcome our control.

On our way to the climb, I noticed two men moving rather slowly across the boulder field at the base of The Block Route and U-Slot. One of the men yelled down to me and the two other climbers I was with saying, “We need help! I had a bad lead fall.”All three of us immediately dropped our packs and made our way up to the party of two, expecting the worst. When we got to them, I began asking them questions about the fall and his injuries. Dan (age unknown), the climber who had fallen, was standing and trying to scramble down between the rocks and trees with his older brother trying to assist him. Dan’s brother stated that he was a paramedic and they just needed a couple of people to help get Dan down to the field so they could get their vehicle. Dan was able to walk but only with assistance from three of us, as he was unable to fully weight his left foot. Dan had major abrasions and rock burn from sliding down the slab of Stone Mountain. The majority of his injuries were on his left side, including his hand, wrist, arm, hip, ankle, and foot. When Dan’s brother arrived with the truck he helped bandage his left arm before they packed up and began the drive out. We encouraged that they seek medical attention but are unsure if they did.AnalysisAs we talked with Dan we found out that he had been climbing for a long time and knew Stone Mountain and Block Route very well but was fairly new to leading.This is a reminder that all climbers should know and understand their limits, especially on lead, and to make sure you pay attention to the route so you don’t stray off, even if you have been on it before.

I was climbing Foreign Trade Zone while a party of two was top-roping some variation of Bat Out of Hell (5.11). The climber reached the top of the route while I was about halfway up Foreign Trade Zone. I heard a “whoosh” and a loud thump and looked down to see the climber yell and bounce off the ground.My belayer lowered me and we sent a couple people up the trail to call 911 and notify Park personnel. Meanwhile, the climber’s partner, a couple others, and I tried to keep him still and attend to a small cut on the back of his head. He was alert, not injured, and otherwise seemed okay. Rangers and EMS arrived fairly quickly and checked him out. He was up and walking around and refused treatment. Both actually kept climbing.His apparent lack of injury was pretty amazing to me. He had fallen from the top of the route, which I’d estimate at ~40 feet, and landed on his back/butt. His belayer had taken him off belay, assuming he was going to rappel, when he was, in fact, expecting to be lowered.AnalysisThis was a case of miscommunication between poorly trained, novice climbers. The climber never requested to be taken off belay. The belayer took him off and called, “Belay is off!” The climber never heard this and expected to be lowered. Anytime there is a belay change, especially at busy crags where it may also be hard to hear, always yell the person’s name in the command. The anchor was inspected and found to have been constructed with the rope passing over a large ledge at the top of the route, thus creating a lot of rope drag. This configuration may have saved the climber from serious injury due to the friction in the system. It actually slowed down at least half of his fall. (Source: Edited from a post by C.

Two climbers, Zack Blevins and Jesse Kale (not part of the climbing party), helped lower Jason onto a large ledge approximately 100 feet from the base of the climb. At this time Blevins regained consciousness but was disoriented. When I arrived, I spoke with Kale, who stated that Jason was conscious and speaking with no obvious injuries but requested water. While awaiting the arrival of Stokes Mountain Rescue, water was passed up to them via rope. Mountain rescue arrived at approximately 1845 and was led to a point directly above the climbers by myself and Ranger Joe Deppe. Mountain Rescue members rappelled to the climbers and assisted them to the base of the climb. Blevins was carried out to an awaiting ambulance by Mountain Rescue and Fire department personnel via Stokes Basket. Blevins was examined by medical personnel and signed a refusal to receive farther medical assistance form. (Source: Craig D. Standridge, Hanging Rock State Park)AnalysisStaying hydrated is an important consideration when exercising in any environment. This is especially true when climbing in North Carolina (or other temperate environments) during the hot and humid summer months. It’s not uncommon to lose one liter of sweat during one hour of exertion. This incident reminds climbers to make sure that they remain hydrated throughout the climbing experience. Climbers should establish a water-drinking regimen in order to maximize performance. It’s recommended that water be ingested prior to exercise and repeated every 15 or 20 minutes. Drinking a half can of soda for an entire day of climbing is clearly inadequate.This rescue effort required over 140 hours of volunteer labor (26 people x 5.5 hours)! This is why climbers should familiarize themselves with basic partner and self-rescue skills in order to facilitate their own rescue. (Source: Aram Attarian)"

The day before the incident, he had been climbing with his brother and another. The park has a climber registration system, but MacDonald did not register and carried no identification. It was not until his brother came to pick him up that rangers knew who he was.This incident caused State officials to review rock climbing policies at Crowders Mountain and the four other State parks that allow climbing. The usual dilemmas are being debated. The cliffs can’t be “patrolled,” because there aren’t enough rangers, and none of the rangers are climbers. Saying that only experienced climbers can register means they would have to have a means of figuring out what “experienced” means, and who is qualified. If the park regulates who is allowed to climb, then it opens itself to legal exposure if someone who passed the test were to get injured.There is no resolution as yet. (Source: Jed Williamson)"

McNeely (age unknown) and her husband David, both experienced climbers, were attempting Little Corner (5.6) a rock climb located on Shortoff Mountain at the south end of North Carolina’s rugged Linville Gorge Wilderness Area. It was late in the afternoon when Ms. McNeely started the climb, getting solid gear placements as she led the first pitch. She was well into the climb when her hand unexpectedly slipped out of a hand crack. She fell backwards approximately 15 feet striking her back on the rock. Her gear held, limiting her fall. Luckily, her head didn’t make contact with the rock, as she wasn’t wearing a helmet, which could have compounded her injuries.David lowered her to the ground. Upon reaching the ground, she had no complaints or concerns about injury. At this point, the couple made plans to climb out, with David taking the lead. However, as the adrenalin rush wore off, Ms. McNeely began to complain of back pain. (She was later diagnosed with four cracked vertebrae). She was also beginning to get uncomfortable and because of her injury and the steepness of the terrain, so she elected not to climb out. This caused the couple to rethink their plans. To compound the situation, the McNeely’s were not prepared to spend the night, as they did not have the appropriate gear.Around 5:30 p.m., David used his cellphone to call Burke County EMS and three of his friends he knew to be climbing at Rumbling Bald, 2.5 hours west of Shortoff Mountain, and asked for their assistance. As late afternoon turned into evening, Marla began to experience back spasms and started to shiver. David started a fire, then huddled with Marla to keep her warm and waited for help to arrive.Burke County EMS arrived cliff top shortly thereafter, followed by the three climber friends around 8:30 p.m. The climbers met rescue personnel at the top of the descent gully. Due to the limited technical expertise of rescue personnel, the climbers made an attempt to get them to the base of the cliff. However, because of wet and icy conditions in the descent gully, the rescuers felt uncomfortable with this maneuver. Instead, two of the three climbers rappelled to the ground with a sleeping bag and other essential gear and made contact with the McNeely’s.When it was decided that due to the nature of the terrain and Ms. McNeely’s condition that it wouldn’t be possible to get her out on foot, a Blackhawk helicopter was requested. It arrived around 3:00 a.m., using the couple’s fire to guide them to their location. Medical personnel stabilized Marla, placed her on a backboard, then carried her to a site where she could be evacuated by helicopter.AnalysisClimbing in Linville Gorge is one of the few wilderness areas on the East Coast that offers high quality climbing experiences. Access is limited and demanding. For this reason climbers should be self-reliant and have the appropriate skills to initiate a self-rescue. In addition, climbers need to have suitable first aid and bivy gear with them and be prepared for the unexpected. Rescue teams should be familiar with the areas in which they are expected to respond to emergencies and have trained and experienced personnel.

B anchored his rope and rappelled down the tail of his rope as far as he could, then down-climbed approximately 30 feet.On his way out for help, he was able to call out at approximately 4:50 p.m. to initiate a rescue. Climbers in the area and rescue personnel gathered and divided into two teams. One team would hike to the base of the climb and begin climbing to L, while the other team would hike to the top.Operations let everyone know via radio communication that a National Guard Blackhawk helicopter with rescuers was enroute to assist. It arrived and located L at 10:02 p.m. and reported that he was in good condition. L was in the helicopter by 10:58 p.m., about six hours after his partner called for help. The helicopter also picked-off the two climbers who were on the route to assist.

It is one of the few wilderness areas in the East that offers high quality climbing experiences at all levels in a remote setting. Access is limited and demanding. For this reason climbers should be self-reliant and have the appropriate technical and self-rescue skills to initiate a self-rescue if possible. (Source: Aram Attarian)"

It was now early evening and two of us decided to try an unnamed route described to us by a climber we met on our previous trip to Ship Rock. We checked out the features and picked out the route as best we could from the ground. I geared up and began climbing. The first part of the climb involved a juggy, run-out section up some blocks and over a small bulge to the base of a low angle slab. The slab offered plenty of protection, so I geared up for the roof above me. After placing good gear near the lip of the roof, I pulled over it without much difficulty and placed what would be my final piece, a BD #2 nut, in a bottleneck six feet or so above the roof.At this point the climb thinned out into a featureless face route for the remaining 15 to 20 feet of the climb. From the beta I had on the route, I knew to the left of my route was a route a grade harder and to the right was a route two grades harder, so I figured the path of least resistance was the route I was on. I continued up and slightly to the left where I saw the most features. As I continued up, more features became apparent on the rock, and after climbing through the majority of the blank face, I came to realize I had split off onto the route to my left, a fall grade harder and more runout than my anticipated route. I stayed calm and took a quick look around, eyeing what looked like a fairly deep three-finger pocket at the very edge of my reach that, if I could get a hold of, would get me through the run-out section to good protection above me. Realizing I had no other options, I committed to the hold hoping for the best. The hold was much shallower and more sloped than anticipated—not enough for my pumped out fingers to clinch onto.The first 12-15 feet of the fall was air. I began to think everything was going to end smoothly until I realized I was passing my last piece. Remembering the low angle slab below me, I braced for impact. Initially I landed square on my right heel, then fell sideways and onto my left side.After explaining what I did wrong and how I got off route to my partner, I sat down near the base of the climb for a while until my partner led the correct pitch and cleaned the gear. With their help, I limped down the short approach trail to the Blue Ridge Parkway and waited by the side of the road for my ride. The damage: a fractured heel bone, a cracked rib, and plenty of scrapes and bruises, but I live to climb another day.AnalysisAlways climb within your limits and, though I didn’t hit my head, wear a helmet!

The first two members of the party had already led up a short 15 meter pitch. Joe was then belayed up from the top. Since the difficulty was very minor, Joe belayed Cameron up the same climb. The rope was properly anchored at the top. In a standing position, Joe proceeded to belay Cameron with a figure eight connected to his harness. He was not separately anchored. Cameron climbed with an extra rope. He slipped on a wet spot about two meters up from the start of the climb. Cameron’s fall pulled Joe off balance. Joe fell face first over the rock. Cameron fell to the base of the climb. Cameron’s weight held Joe from sliding down the slope. (He was still attached to the rope by the figure eight.)Cameron fell and swung into a small tree, with no injury. Joe skinned his left arm and left leg and hit his head just above the left ear, immediately resulting in double vision. Joe never lost consciousness and was soon able to right himself and secure himself. With the aid of the rope Cameron was able to safely climb to Joe and lower him to the base of the climb. (Source: Joseph Hanna)AnalysisFirst of all, we both decided that the accident was caused by a lack of common sense, but more because of the lack of difficulty involved. Seeing no present danger, we overlooked the obvious in eagerness to continue the latter half of the climb.Nevertheless, the system was not checked with understanding. A helmet would have eliminated the seriousness of the injury but would not have prevented the accident. The belayer should have been secured separately, regardless of whether or not he felt secure.The Climbers Guide to North Carolina and previous knowledge of the area allowed us to reach medical care within a reasonable amount of time.

The accident occurred on the first pitch. I was approximately 40 feet off the ground with a cam placed at foot level when I fell. The piece pulled and I fell to the ground landing in a seated position on a boulder at the base of the climb, followed by a roll onto the ground. I never hit my head. (I was wearing a helmet.) I experienced extreme pain in my coccyx and in the center of my back. Both Ian and I are Wilderness First Responders. He log-rolled me into a position on my back, completed primary and secondary surveys, stabilized me the best he could and went for help. There was no one else in the area.One-and-a-half hours later, Ian returned with the local rescue squad who packaged me onto a backboard and litter, transporting me to a trailhead approximately two miles away. Members of the Schenck Job Corps and two North Carolina Outward Bound crews also assisted in the litter carry.AnalysisForty feet seems like a long way up to have placed just one piece of protection, but due to the nature of the climb it was reasonable. The first 30 feet of the climb is a gently sloping slab (5.3-5.4) that offers no protection. The route then traverses up and right above steeper rock. This section is considerably harder but offers good protection. I climbed the easy section, placed a piece to protect myself for 3-4 feet of climbing to a rest stance. I placed a second piece (a mid-sized cam) as high as I could reach. I knew that I needed the first piece higher at the crux, so I backed cleaned it. This left me with only one placement, the mid-sized cam that was well placed in a horizontal crack. I went back and forth several times in the next section trying to work out the sequence. When I fell, I was in the process of down-climbing. I believe that the piece pulled because it had “walked” into a bad position from its original good placement due to the back and forth movement of the rope running through the protection carabiner.In hindsight, there are a number of things that could have been done differently that may have prevented the piece from pulling. A long runner on the cam would have created less drag, allowing the rope to run “smoother.” The cam could have been placed deeper into the crack to prevent “walking.” I could have placed more than one piece in opposition, equalized two pieces, or not back cleaned the first piece. One large lesson I learned is that the first piece needs to be a bomber placement, multidirectional, and minimal potential for “walking.” (Source: Josh Whitmore)"

Mike, Brian, his 15 year- old son Cole, and I had the Cereal Buttress to ourselves. It was still shaded and cool despite a forecast for the high 90s. Cole was leading Fruit Loops as a warm up. Two college-age guys walked by and we joked how we were surprised to see two other masochists climbing on a south- facing wall in July. They laughed, walked past us and started climbing a few routes away. A short while later Mike was top roping a climb, Cole was belaying, and Brian was taking pictures of Mike while on rappel.I wandered over and started taking pictures of another climber, Lorenzo, as he cruised Frosted Flake (5.9). His belayer, JH, and I struck up a conversation about the area and its various access issues. After a few minutes I wandered back to my group. JH top roped their route. A few moments later we heard a frightening sound. Lorenzo called for help and I was at the scene within 30 seconds. JH lay crumpled at the base of the cliff beside a large embedded boulder.Just five weeks earlier, I had taken a wilderness first aid class. I had hoped I would never have to use the knowledge I had gained but was suddenly grateful that I took the class. I yelled for my guys to get down now and call 911. Thankfully, Mike had a signal on his phone. I did a quick assessment. JH was in a fetal position, lying on his right side. He was alert and understood my questions. I realized within seconds we had a spinal issue because he could not move anything except his eyes. They were filled with fear but were still communicative. He could not feel me pinching him. His right thigh had an obvious deformity, and a look under his pant leg revealed an ugly compound fracture. There was little blood loss, though. Cole arrived next as he had lowered Mike to the ground. Brian wisely sent him, the nimblest among us, to run to the parking lot and lead the EMS crew to us once they arrived. The trail system to the Cereal Buttress is complicated and primitive. The last 200 yards involves boulder scrambling. The crew would have been greatly delayed without Cole’s guidance.Brian and Mike hurried to the scene once they were on the ground. At that time I noticed JH was turning ashen colored and his eyes no longer met mine. He had stopped breathing! Despite knowing he had a spinal injury, we had no choice but to straighten him out. We gently pulled his legs and torso away from the wall and got him on his back. Mike and Brian immediately began CPR. I elevated his good leg with a pack to get blood to his torso. I next began extracting him from the tangle of gearand rope around him. I cut him out of his harness and got the cams he was lying on out from under him. I got on the phone with 911 again and gave them an update to relay to the crew. An odd thing is that the call was answered by Polk County 911 rather than Rutherford County.The next people on the scene were Ricky and Brittany, two climbers who had met Cole on his way down. Soon thereafter the Chimney Rock Fire Department’s first responders showed up and we lead them to JH. It took roughly 45 minutes from the time the call went out until the first professionals arrived. Based on our remote location I believe that was a very fast response.During the interim, JH “died” on us several times. Brian and Mike heroically brought JH’s heartbeat back several times using CPR. We all yelled encouragement to JH throughout. I believe he was fighting as hard as he could on the inside.Once the pro’s arrived we gave them all the info we could and got out of the way. We rested, cried, and regrouped. We knew JH was in good hands but also realized the ordeal was far from over. Once the crew had JH on oxygen and inserted an IV, we still had to transport him. Mike, Ricky, Cole and I scouted and cleared a lower trail through the heavily forested talus at the base of the cliff. We met the backboard team and helped them disassemble the stretcher, which had a large rubber tire beneath it for trail travel. The wheel was worthless on the immediate terrain but was awesome once we were later back on a real trail. Ricky ran down the mountain several times to assist in bringing oxygen tanks and IV bags up from lower, slower crews.By the time JH was ready for transport, there were probably 25 people at the scene, all eager and willing to do whatever it took to get this man safely down the mountain. It was a slow, laborious process carrying a stretcher down the treacherous mountainside, especially now that the temperature had risen to above 90 degrees. The volunteers and the professionals worked well together and we eventually got JH down to the wheel at the start of the better trail. Once the wheel was attached, we made excellent progress to a waiting ambulance that whisked JH off to a helicopter waiting in town that in turn took him to Memorial Mission Hospital in Asheville, where doctors found that Joshua had a broken neck. They were unable to fully revive him. AnalysisMike and I hiked the mile back uphill to investigate the scene and lug our gear out. JH’s rappel device was still attached to the rope, but only by a single strand. Frosted Flake has fixed rings at the top. After threading his rope through the rings, JH apparently failed to ensure that both strands of rope were on the ground before he commenced his rappel. The ends and middle of his rope were marked at the factory. He also failed to “close the system”, which means tie a knot in the ends of the rope. Had there been a knot at the end of the rope, it could not have slid through his rappel device and this accident would not have happened. The pictures I took of Lorenzo earlier show that he wore a helmet. JH did not. Mike and I photographed the evidence, then gathered it up and trudged out.

The pair had two ropes, one a climbing rope, the other a non-climbing rope purchased from a box store (origin or type unknown). Both ropes were anchored for a rappel.Both climbers were wearing climbing harnesses. Jane was attached to the box store rope with a prusik loop. The prusik was constructed out of a “shoe lace” looking cord (i.e. not designed for climbing) and attached to her harness with a carabiner. She was not using a belay/rappel device. John was attached to the second rappel rope with the rope running through a carabiner attached to his harness. He had no belay/rappel device.The couple moved to the edge of the cliff to begin their rappel with their backs to the fall line. Based on an examination of the scene, it appeared that Jane fell first while “rappelling” and landed on a four-foot wide rock shelf approximately 40 feet from the top and 15-20 feet from the ground. John went down to help her and then fell to the ground about 60 feet below.Both climbers were discovered with burns on their hands. John suffered two leg fractures (one an open fracture) and Jane had a broken wrist and a spinal injury.AnalysisThis accident speaks for itself. Both individuals had no business attempting to rappel with no knowledge, inadequate equipment, and experience. Upon inspection, Jane’s “prusik” along with the sheath of her rope melted, causing her to lose control. Chances are if she had let go of the prusik sooner it may have prevented her from serious injury. John never had a chance. His burns were a result of his hand being the sole friction device on the rope. He may have forgotten to wrap the spine of his carabiner to create a carabiner wrap (common in military rappelling) in his haste to aid Jane. Rappelling presents a unique set of dangers that aren’t found in other forms of climbing. A functional belay rappel device, a backup system utilizing an autoblock or similar friction knot and the knowledge on how to use it along with the proper equipment may have prevented this unfortunate incident.

According to park personnel, Frank had led the route and upon descent, had left his quick-draws in place. Ms. Nagem then attempted the climb clipping into the preset gear as she climbed. During a point in the climb, Nagen was just out of reach of the next protection point when she asked Frank for slack so she could clip into the next quick-draw. Frank complied, and it was at this point in the climb when Nagem slipped and fell approximately 20 feet, sustaining injuries to both her left leg and arm, and experienced tingling and numbness in those extremities.It took approximately 30 minutes for paramedics to arrive and approximately another hour to get the patient packaged and moved off the mountain to a waiting ambulance.AnalysisIn this case Ms. Nagem’s fall could have been prevented if a top rope protected her.

We had a copy of the older version of Lambert &amp; Shull’s Selected Climbs in North Carolina in which the route was labeled as 100 feet, and therefore, we believed our 70-meter rope (230 feet) to be adequate to lower on.I belayed Adam with a Grigri. While lowering, about ten to 15 feet above the base of the climb, the end of the rope fed through the Grigri and Adam began to free fall. The base of the climb was a 70-degree boulder-strewn slope. He travelled a total of 30–40 feet, may have turned and glanced off an oven-sized rock or two before coming to rest in a relatively soft area of leaves and dirt. His injuries were primarily abrasions, bruises, and a deep laceration on his thumb. After assessment and some first aid, he was able to walk out and drive home. Later, reading the newest version of Selected Climbs… I found the route labeled as 150 feet (a critical change).AnalysisI learned to climb and use equipment from friends and climbing partners and knew the importance of tying a knot in the end of the rope to close the system. Adam and I got into the habit of climbing single pitch routes with an adequate rope length and no knot tied at the end of the rope. No matter the circumstance, a closed system should always be employed. Reviewing the latest version of the guidebook, and not putting undue trust in any guidebook, is also an important lesson learned. (Source: Daryl MacInnes)"

Two young women (I’ll call them Jane and Joan) came walking down from the far end of the tree ledge and said they planned to lead the Great Arch (5.5). We chatted for a little bit and while Joan was racking up for her lead, our leader started off on Mercury’s with me belaying. He got to the first bolt and was scoping out the rock above. Since he was in a secure spot, I felt comfortable glancing over to see how things were going on the Arch.Joan had placed a piece of pro (a medium cam) about ten feet up and was climbing above it into the section where the crack widens before turning the first corner, approximately 20 feet up on the route. She was making a series of layback moves and when she got up to the corner, her hands came off. At this point, she was far enough above her single placement that it never came into play stopping her fall. She skidded down the face for several feet when it appeared that one or both feet caught on something causing her to flip backwards. She free fell the remaining distance to the ground (8-10 feet) and landed flat on her back.Because I had my partner on belay, I couldn’t respond immediately, but the third person in our group and Jane (Joan’s belayer) went to check her condition. She remained motionless on her back. I could tell from where I was standing that she was conscious and that her eyes were moving.My partner replaced his draw with a “bail-out ’biner” on the first bolt and I lowered him so we could assist. By that time, Joan was sitting up and moving her arms around and talking. She reported pain in her arms, hands, and legs, but didn’t show any signs of broken bones. She also said she’d hit her head (she was wearing a helmet) and that she had a mild headache. This immediately sent up red flags to me for head trauma, so I asked her if she was feeling dizzy or experiencing any visual distortion. She said she wasn’t.The landing zone was fortunately free of rocks, but there were numerous tree roots surrounding the area where Joan landed. When she came to rest after the fall, it looked like her head was resting on a root, so presumably this was the point of impact for the head-blow she reported. Her arms showed obvious bruises where she rolled up her sleeves and there was redness on her hands, probably from scraping on the rock. Cursory examination of her scalp showed no broken skin or bleeding. Before long, she was up and moving around, flexing her arms and legs and rotating her head from side to side to see what hurt and what didn’t. She also expressed embarrassment about having taken a fall from what she saw as an easy climb.Jane and Joan had come up to the tree ledge with just one rope; they told us their intention was to climb the Arch and then descend by the walk-off trail. With that no longer an option, they would need to rappel to get to the ground, which of course is a two-rope rappel. We decided to fix their rope from the U-Slot rap station so they could do a single-line rappel, then drop their rope to them. Jane went first with their gear so she’d be on hand for a fireman’s belay if necessary, then Joan rigged her belay/rappel device and rapped down. Before they left, we urged that Joan get medical attention as some head injuries that seem minor can turn out to be life-threatening. They assured us they would do that, and that was the last we saw of them. AnalysisIn terms of observations and analysis of this accident, I guess my two main points would be: One, know your limits; and two, place adequate protection. The Great Arch isn’t a highly difficult route, but the start in my experience has the hardest moves on the whole climb. Getting up and around that first corner involves some lay-back moves that are fairly strenuous. The leader in question seemed to be struggling with the lay-back. Her feet didn’t seem to be high enough when she was making the moves. She would benefit from working similar moves on a top-rope until she gets more strength, technique, and confidence. As to protection, the problem this leader had was that she was so far above the only piece she had placed that it couldn’t protect her fall. Before making the hard lay-back moves, it would have been good to have placed another piece of pro. No one likes to carry a big rack at Stone Mountain, but if you’re not strong enough to make the opening moves without protection, bring the gear you need. One positive comment is that the leader was wearing a helmet. If she hadn’t been, the blow to her head when she hit the root could have been more serious.

The leader placed a cam and a stopper prior to clipping the first bolt on route. After clipping the bolt, the pair decided to back off the route because of approaching darkness. The leader decided to down climb the route, removing protection as he did so. The stopper placed earlier was stuck. To remove it the climber placed a cam above the stopper, clipped in and hung on the rope to work on the stopper. “When I yanked the stopper out, the cam popped and I fell, pulling out the cam below me. I landed on my feet and fell sort of in a sitting position on a log at the base of the climb.”The climber sustained a compression fracture of his vertebrae and required an evacuation by Stokes County Mountain Rescue.AnalysisStarting a route knowing it is going to get dark means you have to understand the route and have the skill to accomplish what needs to be done under these circumstances. A possibility here would have been that instead of down climbing, the climber could have rappelled or lowered off the bolt, removing pro while descending. This practice should only be attempted if the bolt is deemed safe by the climber—as rappelling or lowering off a single bolt is not recommended. (Source: Aram Attarian.)"

After ascending B.O.G. (5.11), both climbers began their descent by rappelling from Boardwalk (5.8), a common rappel point. Both climbers had done this rappel twice during the day. They used a single rope doubled for the descent, making use of the intermediate station approximately 70 feet up the Boardwalk face on its leftmost side.Prior to descending they heard thunder in the distance and rain was imminent. While on rappel, Okie forgot about using the intermediate rappel point and rappelled off the end of his rope. He landed at the base of Firepoint, luckily missing the large rocks at the base of the cliff. He sustained a broken left humerus, a bruised lung, several cracked lower vertebrae, and several small cuts.He was packaged in a litter and carried to the Blue Ridge parkway a short distance away. He was transported to medical facilities in Johnson City, TN, via helicopter.AnalysisIt is not known whether the impending thunderstorm may have hastened the descent.

As AR was attempting to move up onto a ledge, he lost his grip and fell a few feet to a ledge below injuring his ankles. After hitting this ledge, he tumbled down the rockface to the trail below, receiving additional injuries. PB believes AR fell approximately 12 to 15 feet.Pilot Knob Fire Department, Pilot Mountain Rescue Squad, Surry County EMS and the Interagency High Angle Rescue Team all responded. AR was placed in a Stokes basket and hauled up the main descent gully. He was carried out and transported to the hospital, where his injuries were evaluated. He sustained two broken ankles, a fractured right tibia and fibula, broken and dislocated fingers and tom tendons on his left hand. He also cracked ribs and several stitches were required to close a head wound! As of September 10, AR has undergone several surgeries, and still awaiting more.AnalysisSome of the terrain at Pilot Mountain looks relatively easy and for some presents the path of least resistance to the top of the climbing area.

According to his climbing partners, he was beginning his descent when the web sling securing his rappel rope to the anchor “failed.” He fell approximately 60 feet to the ground. He sustained extensive trauma, including head injuries, two broken arms, and broken ribs.AnalysisA self-equalized anchor is only as good as the webbing, cordalette, etc., connecting all points. In this case, the knot (presumably a water knot) securing the webbing came undone. (It was either tied improperly or not tied completely.) Water knots that are used to connect webbing should be checked every time a tied sling is used in an anchor set-up. Water knots have a reputation for loosening themselves. A three-inch tail is considered minimum for this knot.Consider keeping slings untied when storing them; tie them when needed. Get in the habit of inspecting knots (visual and hands on check). BARK: Before leaving the edge, check your harness: Buckle to be sure it is secure and backed through properly; next check your rappel Anchor, then your Rappel/ belay device (making sure it’s attached correctly and the rope(s) run through it properly; finally, check the Knots securing and anchor and belay components.Anchors can also be tested by stepping into a sling clipped into the master- point and bouncing on the anchor. (Make sure you are clipped into a secondary anchor when you do this test!) Also consider using sewn slings for anchor applications or construct a pre-equalized anchor. (Source: Aram Attarian)"

It was broken on both sides and will need surgery, plates, screws, and pins, to put it back together. Other climbers in the area assisted him to the trailhead.No one on the scene is sure why he fell, but the evidence suggests that he was new to the area and got himself in over his head. His girlfriend was belaying with a GriGri, but was not a climber herself. Climbers near the scene reported he was climbing on eyebrows above a crack on a 5.6 single pitch route, possibly “Good Intentions”, when they heard him yell, “Take!” His girlfriend yelled back, “Don’t fall, wait!” He yelled back that his hands were too slick and he couldn’t hold on any longer and to “take” and get ready for the fall. She yelled back, “Please, no, wait!”When he fell it looked like his last piece was at his feet and he was squatting before bailing off and taking a 20-foot fall. By the time he was caught, he swung into a big bulge and immediately broke his ankle.Witnesses reported that it appeared that his belayer had a significant amount of time to take up the slack but didn’t know how to take in slack quickly on a GriGri.AnalysisMoral of the story: belaying is a climbing skill that should not be taken lightly, familiarize yourself (and your significant other) with your chosen belay device!

He fell 75 feet to the ground, landing feet first and pulling two chocks in the process. He broke both ankles and two vertebrae. Both he and his rescuers credit his survival to the fact that he landed on his feet.A week earlier, on the same route, Martin Wade, a student at the University of North Carolina whose home was in Yorkshire, England, fell 90 feet to his death. He was on the last and easiest portion (5.4) of the climb and, in fact, was climbing without protection. It is assumed that he grabbed a loose rock. The route is known for that. (Source: T. C. Price Zimmermann and Winston-Salem Journal, October 15, 1980)AnalysisThe current estimate of regular climbers in North Carolina is 500 but the sport is still fairly new there. Colleges and organizations such as the Carolina Wilderness Institute are teaching climbing, and reports from them indicate a high level of interest. The accident rate from this state is very low, especially considering how new the sport is there. The important thing to note is that the falls which have occurred are typical of beginning climbers: protection failure, failure to test holds, falling from the top of a route after the climb is apparently over, and rappel failure.

Tom was about to pull the final roof. I was watching him climb extremely closely as I intended to climb the route and wanted to see what he did.He placed a 48-inch sling on the last bolt he clipped at the roof and a 24-inch sling combined with a quick draw to extend it on his second-to-last bolt. Because he had climbed past a smaller roof, a lead fall should have put him in the air. I watched him lean out to grab the jug beyond the big roof. His hand looked a little shaky as he reached for the hold, leaning far back from his stance under the roof. I remember thinking, “If he’s having trouble reaching for that, I’m really going to be in trouble.”At this point he fell, and stopped about eight to ten feet below where he started, in mid-air. (Four feet of this was due to the sling). It did not look like a bad fall; it looked safe and his belayer caught the fall with no problem.It was about a full second before he yelled and we saw him looking at his forearm, which had been sliced open to the bones from mid-forearm to the palm, causing him to bleed profusely! We lowered him and called 911 within seconds. A first responder, a surgeon in residency, and a doctor were all climbing near-by and gave assistance until he was carried out.AnalysisAt first we couldn’t figure anything out. Did he hit a rock during his fall? The features below were smooth and sloped and he fell into mid-air. Could he have run his arm over a bolt? The bolts weren’t anywhere near his body during the fall because his arm was way out reaching over a roof.I had seen a story about a Colorado climber becoming impaled on a carabiner at the elbow about a month ago. Because of this, I wondered if catching his arm on the carabiner might have been the cause. It seemed unlikely, since I’d never heard of it happening until I saw the picture a month before, but there was no other equipment or rock near him. I climbed Arms Control up to the point where the long draws were used (his last clipped bolts) to clean as much of his gear for him as I could. I decided to leave the last two slings and carabiners to lower from, and did get all the way to them so I could examine them. During my exam, I noted the quickdraw carabiner on the second-to-last clip was clean. The Helium carabiner on the 48-inch sling had blood and other evidence on it of entering a human! There was no blood above this and actually very little below, for about 15 feet, since he didn’t really start bleeding until he was being lowered. I am certain this carabiner was the one that entered his arm and ripped it from forearm to palm. (Source: Anne McLaughlin, witness)"

Jones II (22), and his partner, Joe Wilson (23) climbed Hindu Kush (5.8), a popular Shiprock route. Shiprock is a popular climbing area located in the Grandfather Mountain Corridor area of the Blue Ridge Parkway. After completing the climb, the pair decided to rappel down to their gear rather than hike back down to the base of the cliff. According to Wilson, they threaded their ropes through the anchors and threw the ropes down one by one. Wilson said when Jones attached himself into the rope via his ATC, he was above the anchors, so he moved to one side and lowered himself to a position below the anchors to begin his rappel. Jones leaned back to rappel and to Wilson’s disbelief, he heard Jones yell and saw him fall approximately 100 feet to the ground.Wilson ran over to the nearby trail that led down to the Rough Ridge parking area, located a hiker with a cell phone, and called EMS. After making the call, he made his way back to Jones. Upon reaching him, Wilson rolled him over to check his pulse and received no response. Evidently, Jones died instantly after hitting the boulders below. EMS arrived shortly thereafter.Linville Central Rescue and Linville VFD members attached Jones to a defibrillator but were unable to revive him. He was transported to Watauga Medical Center in Boone, NC.Analysis:The accident was investigated by National Park Service and Linville Rescue personnel. When topping out Hindu Kush, the first set of anchors which can be seen are those on the aid line, the Odyssey (to the east atop the prow that contains the climb Castaway). While the anchors on Boardwalk are much closer to the standard rappel route, they are obscured from view when finishing Hindu Kush. Lewis and Jones moved over to the Odyssey and set up their rappel through a pair of super-shut anchors, which allow the rope to be clipped directly into the shut rather than threaded through. Both climbers held an end of rope and dropped them to the ground. Jones placed himself on rappel while still on top of the cliff. Somehow in the process of lowering onto the anchors, the rope between the shuts and the climber clipped itself through the shuts, resulting in a bight of rope threaded through both shuts. Apparently Lewis was unaware of this happening. As Lewis eased his weight onto the anchors to get below them, the bight of rope slid through both anchors resulting in the accident. The investigation revealed that the gates of the super-shut anchors played a role in holding weight, as they were bent outward from the main axis of the equipment, suggesting that they were loaded by Lewis’ body weight as he began to rappel.An approaching storm may also have been a factor in the retreat chosen by the climbers.A number of common practices could have been considered: 1) Attach to the anchors via a daisy chain or sling, down-climb to a point below the anchors, and then go on rappel; 2) before going on rappel attach an autoblock, prussik, or similar knot on the rope and attach to the harness, followed by placing a properly threaded rappel device above the pre-placed friction knot; 3) the climbers could have chosen to walk-off the climb, especially if incoming weather was a concern; 4) have your partner check the anchor and rappel setup before going on rappel.

I followed by telling him that a group of rescue personnel were on their way.Shortly thereafter, a group of approximately ten rescuers arrived. The climber was assessed for injuries and after some consultation, he walked out under his own power with minimal assistance.AnalysisClimbers have a responsibility to attempt a self-rescue and that calling 911 should be the very, very last option. Climbers should take personal responsibility for being in the mountains and climbing safely. By adopting skills and gaining the appropriate knowledge, training, and experience, climbers can reduce risks to acceptable limits. More rescues, especially unnecessary ones performed by local and government agencies, have the potential to impact the climbing community negatively.

I set up the belay by building an anchor on the large boulder located on the Crow’s Nest (Pitch 1, &lt; 80 feet). Before Drew started the second pitch, I decided to make the anchor redundant by slinging a smaller boulder located under the larger primary boulder. Drew started the pitch and climbed about 30 feet, placed a cam (unknown #), climbed an additional ten feet, then fell.I was yanked directly to the left, which loaded the smaller boulder, dislodging it. It would have fallen, but I had it slung tight enough that it stayed attached, hanging below me! It was heavy enough (maybe a couple of hundred pounds) that it prevented me from moving. Luckily, there was someone else on the Crow’s Nest who helped me pull the boulder to a small ledge where we were able to pull the sling off, then trundled the boulder to the ground.AnalysisI was inexperienced holding trad falls and was unaware of the forces involved. Most importantly, I should have checked the secondary boulder to make sure it was adequate for an anchor. This can be done in a number of ways. Do a hug test—any boulder you can get your arms around is too small to use as an anchor. Boulders used for anchors should be secured to the surrounding environment and should not move when tested. Rule out any boulder that appears ready to be tipped over the edge. In hindsight, the large boulder would have been an adequate anchor by itself. (Source: Lee Kennedy)"

Older son (12) clipped in to Goldline to rappel using a single wrap around a carabiner. Clearly nervous. Under direction from father, he backed over the edge out of sight. About ten seconds later, there was a long scream (two or three seconds), then a thud. A few seconds later the screaming started again, much to my relief. My climbing partner and I ran over to find son and father together, both shaking very much. Son started to go into shock, father lost as to what to do.We got the victim out of his seat, determined that his ankle was badly sprained and then dressed a variety of abrasions. His back was badly abraded crosswise, indicating that he had been out of control during the rappel. After all were calmed down and injuries temporarily dressed, the father took off with the son, carrying him. Other son took gear. (Source: Stephen Perry)AnalysisThe victim fell 12 meters. He was wearing shorts and running shoes, but no helmet. He was not belayed. The boy’s father was using the old U.S. Army rappel, but with only a single wrap and no gloves for the rappeller. As Stephen Perry, the climber who reported the accident pointed out, “Somebody—anybody—briefing them on rock could have prevented this.” But they were isolated from other groups, set up fast, and then the accident happened quickly.This accident is included in the data base, though clearly the leader and victim are not climbers.

He was wearing a helmet. Williams, a climber with 1-3 years experience, placed several pieces of gear as he climbed the crack below the bulge (crux). Standing beneath the bulge, he placed a #2 Camalot as high as he could reach into the vertical crack that splits the bulge. From this position, he attempted to climb upwards, moving his foot out to the right of the crack. Finding no place for his toe, he slipped and fell back and to the left below the bulge. This caused the #2 Camalot placement to fail. His fall was stopped by a well-placed #.5 Camalot. Some time during the fall, Williams stuck his ankle, breaking it. An evacuation by Transylvania County EMS and volunteers was necessary. Williams was in a great deal of pain, even though he was sedated with morphine. The carry-out was difficult from both his standpoint and that of the rescuers.AnalysisWilliams was lead climbing on the route that some call the most dangerous climb (from a serious injury standpoint) at Looking Glass Rock. One explanation may be that new climbers, often not skilled at placing “trad” gear, are sandbagged by the 5.7 rating that appears in the guidebook. That, plus the fact the “Second Coming” starts with a benign-appearing crack that suckers the climber into believing that it will continue being as easy as it seems at the beginning. Poorly-placed gear near the “bulge,” nervousness when actually attempting to climb it, pro that fails to hold when loaded with a climber’s weight—all of these factors figure into the frequency/severity of injuries that take place on the route. In Ben’s case, he had fallen at the same spot two weeks prior to his injury in May. The difference was that on his first fall at the crux, the piece, a #2 Camalot, held. On May 5th, it pulled. Why didn’t it fail the first time he fell? Most likely because Ben took more time in placing it properly when he first encountered that spot. During the May 5 climb, he may have placed the Camalot too quickly and carelessly, assuming first that he knew what he was doing because he had fallen on the same piece at the same place before and all went well, and second that on this “return” visit to the route, he was READY TO CLIMB and did not expect to fall again.Familiarity and practice placing gear, better position, and anticipation of “what if this piece pulls” may have prepared the climber for the unexpected.

D. (26) and female, JD (20s) were attempting Helmet Buttress (5.6) on September 2. J. D. was belaying B. D. on the first pitch, which includes a traverse. B. D. fell at the end of the traverse. His feet were level with his last piece of protection (approximately 18 feet out). During the fall the right side of his head struck a tree on the route, resulting in a laceration and a serious skull fracture. B. D. remained conscious as J. D. lowered him to the ground. Two climbers on a nearby route with Wilderness First Responder training arrived almost immediately and begin first aid. J. D. was instructed to maintain a “hands-on stable” position on B. D.’s neck. Once B. D. was stabilized, the other climber ran to the Table Rock Recreation Area parking lot and accessed B. D.’s cell phone, and called 911. The North Carolina Outward Bound School was also notified by a runner (located at the base of the mountain and the local SAR unit), and were first to arrive on the scene. At 12:15 (approximately three hours after the accident) B. D. was evacuated via helicopter to hospital in Asheville, NC. Surgery removed a fist-sized blood clot from B. D.’s skull. He was unconscious and on a respirator for four days. One month later he was approximately 90 percent and recovering.AnalysisThe use of a helmet may have prevented or minimized this injury. B.

AG was leading a 5.8+ climb with AA belaying. They were using a 60-meter rope and were both wearing helmets. The topo of the climbing area notes the climb is 100 feet long, making a 60-meter rope adequate. AG climbed it clean and was being lowered by AA. AG was cleaning the bolt closest to the ground and asked AA how much rope she had left. He replied it was fine. At 2:45 p.m., just after AG cleaned the last piece of gear, AG was lowered off the end of the rope and fell to the ground.The bolt was about 25-30 feet off the ground. She and eyewitnesses (BG and CM) believe the fall was 15-20 feet. She landed on her tailbone and rolled backwards five feet down a small slope on to her left side. She complained of pain in her lower back, buttocks, and left hip. She tried to stand and immediately felt nauseous and that her legs couldn’t support her. It became clear to her climbing partners that she would not be able to walk out.At 3:03 p.m., CM called the North Carolina Outward Bound School (NCOBS) to report the incident. NCOBS sent a total of 15 staff to assist in the carry-out. Burke County Rescue arrived with one Paramedic and three volunteers just as OB staff were completing the packaging of AG in the litter. In the field, paramedics started an IV for fluids and gave AG a total of six mg of morphine over a two-hour period. Initial evaluation suggested severe bruising and abrasions, but no spinal damage or fractures. Later, AG was informed that a piece of small bone at the bottom of the sacrum was broken.AnalysisThe 60-meter rope in use belonged to BG, who had climbed the same route using the same rope on a number of previous occasions without incident. The position of the belayer in relationship to the route (uphill or downhill) may have played a role in the length of the rope, in this case shortening it by 20 feet. To prevent incidents like this from happening, belayers need to get into the habit of tying into the end of the rope and either placing a knot at the end of the rope or securing the end of the rope.

Witnesses on the scene described the climber as “out of control” as soon as he began his descent. The climber let go of the rope and fell 30 feet to the base of the route.He was conscious and alert after the accident. He suffered an open head wound and other facial lacerations. He was evacuated by Pilot Mountain rescue and EMS personnel to NC Baptist Hospital in Winston Salem.AnalysisThe Australian style (also called “butterfly”) rappel has no utility in a rock- climbing environment. If is to be undertaken by military personnel or sport rappellers in a climbing setting, it should be done in a slow, controlled descent. A belay would have made the outcome of this incident different. It is not known whether or not the victim was wearing a helmet or gloves. Chances are he was wearing neither. This equipment may have prevented the loss of control and head injury. (Source: Aram Attarian)"

Ringo was approximately 20 to 25 feet on route when he fell. His belayer was unable to arrest his fall. He subsequently fell to the ground where he broke his right ankle. A backpack and some resistance from the belay device seems to have slowed his descent, thus reducing the potential for further injury. Further investigation revealed that Ringo’s partner was an inexperienced belayer and was taught how to belay prior to the rock climb.Crowders Mountain State Park personnel and Crowders Mountain Fire and Rescue completed the litter evacuation of Mr. Willoughby. (Source: Jane W. Conolly, Park Ranger II, Crowders Mountain State Park, and Aram Attarian) AnalysisThis incident speaks for itself. Belaying is a fundamental climbing skill that is learned and perfected over a period of time. It is not a skill that can be taught (or should be taught) in a few minutes prior to beginning a rock climb. In addition, Mr. Willoughby was not wearing a helmet. Given the dynamics of the fall and the condition of the site where Mr. Willoughby landed, he is lucky that he didn’t suffer a head injury. (Source: Aram Attarian)"

After completing the first pitch, Lantham, the leader, constructed a belay anchor under a large roof. He placed the belay anchor low and redirected the rope through a single piece placed overhead. His second fell, causing the upper placement to take the force of the fall, causing it to pull out. The resulting shock-load caused the belayer to lose control of the belay and drop the second.The victim remained dangling on the rope for several hours after falling approximately 50 feet. Stokes County Mountain Rescue lowered the climber to the base of the wall around 7:30 p.m. The climber was airlifted to Baptist Hospital in Winston-Salem. He had a fractured ankle and possible internal injuries.AnalysisThree important factors should always be considered when setting up any belay: Anchor (SRENE: Strong, Redundant, Equalized, No Extension), friction (belay device), and position (climber in relationship to his/her anchor and direction of pull). In this case, the leader ignored his position in relation to the direction of pull and the dynamics of a potential fall. The climber should have positioned himself below the anchor rather than above it, in either a sitting or hanging belay with the belay device attached to the harness. Redirecting the rope in a hanging belay can be done more efficiently, especially if the belayer is facing the anchors. Or the leader may have had more control if the belay device was attached directly to the belay anchor via a Munter hitch, GriGri, or other device suitable for this purpose. This approach may have given the belayer more options, especially in executing a belay escape and assisting his partner, or the leader could have climbed through the overhang and set up his belay— the preferred set-up.

Hoping to do some sport climbing (I read that the routes were sparsely bolted) I brought only a limited rack. I climbed the first pitch on the entrance to “The Great Arch” and prepared to set up a top-rope so that my wife could enjoy a climb. I tied a sling (nylon webbing) to a tree and had my wife lower me off. About halfway down it became apparent that my rope was too short. I climbed back to the top and found a lower tree to girth hitch the sling to. When I leaned back to lower off, the water knot on the sling popped open. I fell 30 feet before snagging a bush, still 60 feet off the ground. During the fall, my ankle snagged in the crack and broke in two places. Some of the local climbers set up a rope which enabled a guy to rap down to me, tie me into his harness, and then rap the rest of the way down the crag.This accident has “impatient” and “unprepared” written all over it. Because most of my one year prior climbing experience took place in a gym, my concept of climbing had little to do with safety. I mistakenly thought that if I could physically do a climb, then all would be well. Solid anchoring systems was something prior to that accident I simply hadn’t given much thought. The impatient part came about due to an approaching thunderstorm. I wanted to get that climb in before the storm came and “ruined” my chance to climb.The guys that got me off the bush—which I’m sure saved my life—were excellent, and I am extremely grateful to them. I hope I can return the favor.I’m sending this in because a friend of mine read an accident report that sounded exactly like mine (one sling, water knot pops, broken ankle, guys from NC to the rescue) except it took place in Joshua Tree. The similarity is amazing. Also, I hope people will learn more about safety before moving from the gym to the crags. (Source: David Tart)"

About a month’s worth of planning had gone into our climb. We had selected the route, New Diversions (5.10), and were looking forward to our first bivvy.I had been climbing almost weekly for about four years while Todd had been actively climbing about two years longer. I am a 5.8 leader with a couple 5.10 top rope and sport climb successes while Todd leads 5.10 with a few 5.11 climbs under his harness. (“Way- honed hardmen” is not a climbing accolade either of us will be hearing any time soon.) Neither of us had ever taken a serious lead-climbing fall.As we made the 3½ hour drive from Charlotte to Cashiers, we wondered if the article in the (then) current issue of Climbing magazine along with the mild weather and holiday weekend would make Whitesides more like “Woodstock” with hordes of wannabe big-wall climbers (like us) crowding the mountain.But when we reached the parking lot at the tourist trail there were only two other cars there. Each party was pretending to be asleep, thinking we might be rangers there to enforce the “no camping” policy. Our late-night preparations for the following morning “awakened” the other parties and they, too, began racking gear and checking route descriptions. Fortunately, the others had designs on routes other than the one we had in mind.The route book said the first pitch was a runout 5.7, so I was surprised to find a good #0 Camalot placement only 20 feet up. With the possibility of hitting the deck minimized, I continued on to the first belay with no problem. Mentally confirming the moderate grade, I felt reassured that this would be no sandbag epic.Todd led pitch two, another 5.7 section only better protected. After pulling the haul bag up, I followed. Two or three moves up I spied a nicely shaped flake to pull on. “Great hold!” I thought. As the little flake snapped off, my normally “cat-like” reflexes could do nothing as I watched the pancake-sized rock smack me squarely between the eyes. As I shook off the cobwebs, I wondered two things: What would have happened had I been leading? and Would a helmet have deflected the blow, had I been wearing one? (Neither Todd nor I owned a helmet.)The rest of the pitch went easily and after pulling up the haul bag a second time we felt we could reach the sixth pitch bivvy well within the allotted time frame. I led pitch three (silently thankful that it would be Todd’s turn to pull the haul bag this time) placing gear liberally to protect the climb. Near the end of the pitch I came to a small roof section. After scanning the line for the best means of ascent (read, “path of least resistance”), I decided to place extra gear to back up the horn I had girth-hitched as my primary point of protection. Feeling confident in my gear (if not my alleged abilities) I committed to the small roof. Once into the sequence I found that the moves that looked so reasonable from ten feet away now seemed several grades harder. Frantically trying to remain calm, I quickly checked all the available handholds and footholds. Seconds later I was at the “moment of decision” when I knew I would have to commit to a sequence of moves or completely pump out and fall. My feet were on good rock, though I was on tiptoe. The most reasonable looking handhold was up and to the left, barely within reach. I reached for it and realized immediately it was a sloper with no edge to prevent my fingertips from sliding off.My next conscious thought was, “Wow! My gear held!” As I pendulumed high above the ground, I tried to remain calm but the rush of adrenaline made me giddy. Todd yelled up, asking if I was all right. I was pumped and out of breath, but realizing that my gear was intact I responded, “Yeah—just give me a few minutes and I think I can do this.” As I collected my thoughts hanging off the rock face, I did a mental and physical inventory. The only apparent damage was some slight skin abrasion to both of my exposed ankles.Ten minutes later, my heart rate still elevated (read, “scared shitless”), I began to feel pain in both my ankles. I relayed this information down to Todd and after some discussion we decided that I would rappel down the belay and he would lead the section. When I reached the belay, both ankles were swelling. Todd led the pitch back to the point of my fall and made it through with the comment, “Yeah, that section’s kinda tough.” He set up the belay and I began climbing.Weighting my ankles with climbing moves produced serious pain in both ankles. No stranger to sports injuries, I had the sinking feeling that this was not the kind of pain that would be going away soon. When I reached the point of my fall I knew I would not be able to weight my ankles enough to do the crux moves. I pulled out my ascenders and fixed them to the rope. As I was adjusting the lower one, I dropped it. I had the presence of mind to yell, “ROCK,” as I watched my beloved gear bounce 200 feet to the base of the mountain. Insult had been added to injury.At the belay we took stock of our situation. My ankles were looking worse by the moment. I felt responsible for screwing up our climb and voted to bivvy on the ledge we were resting on for the night. Todd voted for aborting our climb and rapping off the mountain. When the effects of the adrenaline still pumping through me wore off, I might not be able to limp out by morning, he argued.After an hour’s rest we began to rappel the three pitches to the base. My ankles were swollen twice their normal size and I began to believe I had broken both. Forty-five excruciating minutes later we were at the base of the mountain with about a hundred pounds of gear, darkness descending, and an hour hike back to my van. (An hour hike for a healthy individual, that is.) Todd was gracious enough to carry 75 pounds of the gear and promised to come back for me after loading it in my van. I estimated that it would take me four hours to make it back. Three hours later, having crawled on my hands and knees and fashioned a crutch of sorts from a tree branch for pitiful limping, I saw Todd’s headlamp on the trail ahead. He relieved me of the rest of the gear and I promised to meet him at the van. An hour and a half later I crawled down the stairs leading to the parking area and back to my van where an equally exhausted Todd lay sleeping. It was 0030.My wife, awakened by my noisy entrance at 0430, came downstairs fearing someone was breaking in. Quite shocked by my presence, she (a nurse) quickly confirmed my diagnosis: two severely sprained ankles. It turned out my situation was not that bad. I crawled around on my hands and knees for the remaining two days of my long weekend holiday and ate large quantities of ibuprofen to minimize the pain. By the fifth or sixth week following my accident I went climbing again, but was only able to climb sub-5.7 routes. Not only had I lost significant strength, my alleged “boldness” was decimated as well.Now, almost five months after my accident, I am finally climbing at my former level. I am hoping to convince Todd to attempt New Diversions again next Labor Day. I think I’ll wear a helmet this time.

He had full big wall set- up including a portaledge, which was not deployed.Parker was planning on fixing to the top of Invisible Airways (Al), descending, and attempting the Brain Wall the next day. Parker called Looking Glass Outfitters at 11:15 a.m. Parker was calm but in shock, coming in and out of periods of fright. He told me that he had “blown a cam hook trying to clip the bolt on the route and hit the Waste Ledge”. (The bolt is approximately 15 feet from the anchor on an 80-foot pitch). I asked him how he hit and if he was okay. He informed me that he had flipped upside down and landed on the back of his head and neck and that his helmet was destroyed. He was complaining of lower back pain. He was going to attempt to rappel down to the ground. I instructed him to stay on the ledge and that we would come out to get him. I didn’t want him to rap if he had a head injury for fear that he would rig the rappel wrong and take a ground fall from the Waste Ledge. The ledge is 80 feet off the ground.At this point there were three climbers in the shop hanging out and we confirmed the best course of action. The first phone call out of the shop was to Karsten Delap, who is on the Brevard Rescue Squad and is a local guide. He was out of the state and unavailable. The second call was to Marcus Webb in an attempt to organize a climbing team to go to the site. Marcus was unavailable. The third call was to Patrick Weaver of AMI for insight on the issue. Patrick gave instructions based on the above description and instructed us to call Parker back, ask a series of questions, and then re-ask those questions. Parker called the shop phone again and Patrick and I assessed the head injuries over the phone. Parker was doing better but still coming in and out of periods of fright. At this point Patrick and I decided to call 911, as his MOI was a possible 60-foot ledge fall on to his head. Joe Morchebacher was in the shop and was willing to help out as was the Black Diamond Rep Matt Ginley and his girlfriend, a former EMT. Joe M. gathered climbing gear and we drove out to the North Face parking lot following an ambulance.Upon reaching the base of Looking Glass with paramedics and two members of the BRS, we ran into Nathan Brown and Frost Walker, two highly competent climbers. We briefed Nathan, who is a paramedic, and he volunteered to jug Parker’s fixed rope to the Waste Ledge. After jugging the rope, Nathan took over, assessed Parker, and deemed no spinal injury but a probable tailbone injury. He then proceeded to slowly lower Parker to the paramedics on the ground. With the assistance from medics Parker limped out to the bottom of the boulder field where he boarded a BRS six-wheel ATV and was driven out the trailhead. Back at the parking lot, he refused treatment and then was taken by friends to Mission Hospital in Asheville for assessment and x-rays.

Before he knew it, Chris was in over his head. Instead of continuing, he had Mark lower him to the ground. Mark said he felt sure he could finish the route instead of leaving some of Chris’ gear behind. A third climber had recently bailed on another nearby route and this compounded the pair’s frustration at leaving routes unfinished.Mark successfully led the first pitch to a belay anchor just under the dolphin head feature of the climb. Chris followed to the belay. Mark started the second pitch and placed a cam to the right of the feature as he attempted to pull over it. He successfully stepped back down to the belay after one or more failed attempts. On two subsequent attempts to get over the feature, he fell trying to step back down to the belay. On the first two falls, he recovered and tried again after a few minutes. While trying to pull over the feature for a third time, he hooked his foot on the feature in such a way that when he fell, his foot over-rotated and he fractured his ankle at the base of the tibia.Chris was able to lower Mark from the belay to the ground, where a third climber assisted. During the lower, the rope got tangled around a “chicken head.” Chris was able to keep Mark locked off and loosen the rope until it was freed. After being lowered to the ground, Chris rappelled from the belay anchor and pulled the rope.Mark was able to stand, but could not walk, so he mostly “scooted” down the trail. The party called for assistance with their cell phone from North Carolina State Park Rangers, since the trail was too narrow for assisted walking. A pick-up truck reached the climbers at the upper-most area that could accommodate a vehicle. Mark was transported in the bed of the truck while Chris and the third climber were driven back to the climber’s parking lot by the rangers. Unsure of the condition of his ankle (but suspecting a moderate to severe sprain), Mark was driven home. A visit to his doctor the next day revealed the broken ankle.AnalysisWe were both tired from a day of climbing. Chris was attempting a route above his ability. We should have left the stopper in place that Chris originally lowered from and walked away. Alternately, we should have converted the belay anchor into a rappel anchor and lowered off after falling the first time on the feature We should not have attempted to press on.

This was my first experience with rappelling, and I was given no instruction other than to trust the rope. Scott had rigged me for the rappel in such a fashion that the belaying line was in my hand with the safety line. There was too much friction. When it was necessary for me to traverse left to get around an overhang, I slipped on a lichen patch because there was still too much tension on the lines in my hand. I pivoted and crashed the rock with my jaw. Tim belayed me immediately and I came to with no safety line in my hand. I was stunned and bleeding from a deep cut in my jaw and I was very confused. I reduced the dislocation while hanging there, and after resting for a while, recovered the lines and started over. Again I pivoted and crashed, this time abrading my right shoulder.

Holenberg had hiked three miles in to the falls, scrambled to the top, then solo rappelled down the face of the 80-foot-high cliff. He was using a very small (9 mm diameter) rope with an anchor and a figure-eight descending device. Witnesses said that he took very long bounds down the cliff, shock-loading the system, and that he was two-thirds of the way down the cliff when the rope severed and he fell about 30 feet to the boulder field at the bottom of the cliff. Bystanders called via cell phone for assistance.Rangers arrived on scene by 5:00 p.m. Park medics stabilized Holen- berg and the rescue team conducted a semi-technical rescue operation to remove him from the boulder field and get him down to the trail surface. He was then evacuated by wheeled litter to an ambulance at the trailhead, transferred to a medical helicopter, and flown to the UT Medical Center in Knoxville.

He had led Good Intentions (5.6) and traversed right to a set of rappel bolts over the climb Left Up, where he anchored to the bolts with the intent of being lowered. On his descent he was swinging over to remove gear.At some point, the belayer stated that the rope end passed through the belay device and the climber fell to the ground. The climber suffered head and other injuries to the chest. EMS services were contacted and the patient was airlifted to Mission Hospital in Asheville, NC.AnalysisThe rope was tied to the climber and there was no apparent failure at the anchor point. There were still four pieces of gear in the rock that the rope was going through. The end of the rope on the belay side was approximately 25 feet in the air. The climber was wearing a helmet. The length of rope was unknown. The belay end of the rope did not have a back up knot. Typically a 60-meter rope will not be long enough to complete this maneuver.Please remember to close the system while climbing. Either tie a back up knot on the end of the rope or tie in the belayer. This is measure can help prevent incidents. Also, please wear helmets while climbing. (Source: Patrick Weaver - Appalachian Mountain Institute)"

Richter (23), one of the participants, fell approximately 35 feet. His injuries included a compound fracture of the left arm, fracture to both ankles, left wrist and two broken ribs.According to A. Whitaker, Park Superintendent, Richter was participating as a “victim” in the training. J. Shelton, Surry County Director of Emergency Services, noted that Richter was being lowered when a “rigging system failed.” Evidently, his fall was a result of another participant’s inability to maintain control of the safety equipment.Richter was carried out in a Stokes Basket and transported to Baptist Hospital In Winston Salem, NC via helicopter.AnalysisWhen new skills and techniques are being taught in a training environment, extra measures should be taken to safeguard participants. For example, make sure that “victims” and primary systems are backed up. In this case, Mr. Richter should have been belayed.One statement that was made by an EMS official was that, “When you do a scenario like this there are chances that something will happen.” We would suggest that this need not be the case.This accident is similar to one that occurred at Pilot Mountain a couple of years ago during an organized training session by a group practicing rappelling techniques. In that case a novice rappeller (not on belay) lost control, fell, and was seriously injured. (Source: Edited from reports by Barry A.

An adjacent climber heard my belayer’s cries for help, and climbed (solo) to where I was stuck (about 20 meters above the ground) and freed me so I could be lowered to the ground, where I regained consciousness. I was taken to Baptist Hospital in Winston-Salem due to the head injury I had received, and was treated there for head lacerations, skull fracture, neck fracture, sprained ankle, strained wrist, and abrasions.

John was leading the first pitch and was about 100 feet off the ground at the 5.7 crux, where he placed a stopper. After a few unsuccessful attempts at the crux, John was lowered to the ground through the single stopper placement.Jane Doe decided to give the climb a try and began to top-rope on the single stopper placed earlier by John. She was able to work her way through the crux and ignored a good ledge and the standard belay for the route. Instead she climbed past a large flake and continued up the second pitch of the climb, reaching the double crack system.There are two crack systems on the second pitch: one diminishes while the other begins about 15 to 20 feet to the right of the first. Jane could not find her way up the first crack and did not see the second crack to the right. (This would be the easiest way to the top of the second pitch).Jane placed then lowered off a blue tri-cam. John lowered her to the large flake about 20 feet below the tri-cam placement, where she was able to build a three-point anchor using passive pro in the flake. Once the anchor was built, Jane brought John up to her position, belaying him from her harness with a re-direct through the anchor.Once John arrived and clipped into the anchor, he lowered Jane off his belay device attached to his harness with the rope re-directed through the anchor. Once Jane had been lowered approximately 120 feet to the ground, John began building a rappel anchor by repositioning it a little higher in the flake. (He thought that the rock was a bit hollow where Jane had positioned it earlier). John placed a stopper in the crack as the primary anchor point. This placement was backed up with a second stopper on a sling. The two pieces were placed close together with room between them (not equalized). Once the anchor was built, John placed himself on rappel.Somewhere between the start of his rappel and approximately 100 feet from the ground, the top stopper failed. The rest is speculation, but it is believed that the force of the top stopper failing and the bottom catching created a shock-load that caused the second stopper to fail. At this point, Jane stated that she heard John scream. She looked to see John falling from 100 feet above! John hit a ledge about 30 feet below the crux and tumbled down the slab below.Brevard Rescue Squad responded to Jane’s 911 call and evacuated John via litter and backboard. He sustained lacerations to the top of his head, a broken shoulder blade, a severe contusion on his elbow, a broken wrist (requiring surgery), and a bruised hip. John was not wearing a helmet. He was transported to Mission Hospitals in Asheville, NC.AnalysisA couple of potentially dangerous scenarios were evident in this event. First, John was lowered through a single nut placement, then Jane chose to top- rope through that same single nut rather than pull the rope and re-lead the pitch. These actions are a high-risk maneuver given that a single stopper protects the climbing 100 feet off the deck! While it didn’t contribute at all to the accident, it in itself could be considered a near miss.Second, by placing all of the anchor points behind a flake they were literally “placing all of their eggs in one basket.” A common test to determine the integrity of a flake is to strike it. If it sounds hollow avoid it. Flakes are known to expand. This is especially true when using passive protection like stoppers. The wedging action of the stoppers more than likely caused the flake to expand, causing the anchor to fail. Safer options may have included abandoning the climb once John was on the ground, rappel off an equalized anchor, or to continue up easier terrain to the Gemini Cracks rappel anchors. As always a helmet is recommended! (Source: Edited from a post on carolinaclimbers.org and Aram Attarian.)"

After arriving, his partner suggested that they climb Talkin’ ‘Bout Mud Flaps instead of continuing to Second Stanza, their intended climb. Jeff reluctantly agreed. Later, he commented that he had a bad feeling about the route and that he didn’t feel comfortable with his decision, as he had a very limited amount of lead climbing experience, especially at this level of difficulty.Jeff recalled starting the climb and missing clipping the first fixed anchor. He continued upwards and placed a stopper and in the process of placing a cam to backup the stopper he lost his footing and began to fall, the stopper popped. He remembers die sensation of being in mid-air, then striking the ledge below with his heels and doing a clean flip before hitting the ground. Joe mentioned that when the stopper popped, “It was the sickest sound I’ve ever heard.”Chris Rhyne and his partner who were climbing nearby, were first on the scene and with the help of Joe’s party were able to evacuate him using a piggyback carry. This was a difficult task, as the terrain and narrow climbers trail proved to be very demanding. After reaching the main Table Rock (TR) trail, the rescuers were able to do a two-person carry down to the TR parking lot and their vehicle. Joe was driven to Sloop Memorial Hospital in Crossnore, N.C., approximately one hour away where his injuries were assessed.AnalysisOverall the climbers, with assistance, were able to initiate a self-rescue.

I proceeded there and met Gaston EMS and Chapel Grove Volunteer Fire department, who had sent in a hasty team to assess victim. I led EMS and extrication team to the site. The victim (30) was placed in a Stokes litter. The terrain is steep and rugged, and required that the litter be belayed and lowered approximate 130 yards down the backside trail to an ambulance.According to the victim’s wife, the rope and carabiner “unclipped” from a fixed bolt as he fell. A nut placed below the bolt also came out, sending D. P. on a 30-foot fall. D. P. landed flat on his back between two boulders. His wife, a nurse, said D. P. had a little difficulty breathing at first, but when she did a head tilt, chin lift, he began breathing normally. He never lost consciousness. D. P. received two stitches to the cut on the back of his head and minor first aid for other cuts and abrasions and was released. (Source: M.P. Edwards, Crowders Mountain State Park)AnalysisWhen clipping fixed protection, it is important to consider the orientation of the rope and how it runs through the carabiner. Make sure the rope does not pass over the carabiner gate because it may cause it to unclip accidentally. We can only speculate how the carabiner became detached from the bolt. There is a good chance that if the climber had been wearing a helmet, he may not have needed the stitches. (Source: Aram Attarian)"

(30) both moderately experienced climbers, set off to climb Maginot Line (5.7) and Paradise Alley (5.8) on Shortoff Mountain, located at the south end of the Linville Gorge Wilderness Area. The following description of the events leading up to the incident is described by J. Matthews.Nathan and I are both WFRs and he is an AMGA TRSM. I have taken the AMGA TRSM course, but have not passed the exam. We have both led groups of youth climbing. We both wear helmets. However, neither of us had been out climbing for a couple of monthsWe climbed Maginot Line easily and took some time at the top to enjoy the warm January day. By the time we reached the base of Paradise Alley, it was near 4:30 p.m., but we both had headlamps warm layers and felt solid so we set off. Nathan led the first pitch with some difficulty, hanging on the rope a couple of times but taking no falls. I seconded with some difficulty, attributed to mostly fatigue. At the top of pitch one, I consulted the guidebook and set off.We were using the Lambert/Shull Guide, which marks the route as moving straight up from the belay (the Kelley Guide includes more detail and marks a short blocky scramble to the left before moving left). I climbed straight off the belay and pulled a small roof to gain the face. When I reached the face, I realized I was off-route because the rock was covered in lichen and the climbing difficulty seemed well beyond the 5.8 rating. I knew I needed to move left and I saw what appeared to be a good stance up and to the left. I placed a .3 C4 and started to move up and left towards the stance. I had gone approx 20 feet with protection when I came off the rock.We were climbing with double ropes and as I fell, one of the ropes caught my leg and flipped me upside down. The total distance of the fall was about 40 feet. The C4 held. Nathan caught my fall, but was pulled upwards about eight feet. When the rope caught my weight, I did a pendulum swing into the rock. The impact was focused on my left shoulder.By now it was dark. After an initial period of assessment (and a good amount of screaming and yelling), Nathan rigged the ropes to lower me and brought me to the ground. After cleaning the anchor and salvaging what gear he could, he joined me at the base of the cliff. Here, we assessed our options for an evacuation. Our choices included calling for a rescue, bushwhacking to the river and hitting a gravel road, or ascending the approach gully and then hiking back to the car. We chose to ascend the gully because I was able to walk and we didn’t want to bushwhack in the dark. The approach gully includes two fifth class sections. We made it to the first fifth-class section, an overhanging rock of approximately 20 feet in height. Nathan ascended the single fixed rope. At the top he built an anchor and rigged a 3:1 to haul me up the rock. About two-thirds of the way up the rock, two of the three anchor points blew and I slammed into the rock. I don’t believe this caused any further injury, but it sure hurt like hell!The second fifth class section went without incident. We hiked the remaining section of trail back to the car. The evacuation, from accident to vehicle, had taken approximately five hours. We drove to Mission Hospital in Asheville, where I was treated for a badly broken collarbone and a broken scapula, as well as a laceration on the elbow to the bone, a hematoma on the hip, bruised ribs, sternum, elbow, and ankle, and torn ligaments in the rotator cuff. The elbow and the hip were suspected to be fractured but x- rays proved negative. After follow-up assessment, the collarbone required reconstructive surgery with “bone putty”, seven screws, and a six-inch titanium plate. As of September 1st, I am still in physical therapy, but returned to the rock two weeks ago—the first time since my accident.AnalysisIn hindsight, there were a number of things we could have done which may have prevented this accident. First, we should have been satisfied after climbing Maginot Line, and not starting a multi-pitch climb at 4:30 p.m. in January. Fatigue should have been a warning sign, suggesting to us that it would have been best to descend after completing the first pitch. When I realized I was off route and run out, I could have exercised caution and down-climbed, or I could have consulted more than one guidebook for route information, placed more protection, or stayed home and watched football! (Source: John Matthew)Additional Comment: Linville Gorge is a remote area with very challenging terrain and access. Rescue is often difficult and demanding in time, manpower, and equipment. Both climbers did an excellent job of being self-sufficient and skilled in initiating a self-rescue. (Source: Aram Attarian)"

Scott also had some wilderness medicine training in his background. Chris describes their misadventure as follows:Neither of us had experience in establishing new routes, but over the previous year, we were increasingly drawn by the lure of exploring some un-touched rock faces in eastern Jackson County. One cliff in particular caught our fancy, so in the second half of 2007, we twice scouted Gray’s Ridge, which forms the high, northwest side of Wolf Creek Gorge in the Little Canada section of Jackson County. At its highest, the southeast-facing cliff is about 450 feet, broken by at least one major, wooded ramp. The approach is a strenuous bushwhack and there were no visible signs that it had ever been climbed. Finally on March 9th, we got a late start and made the roughly one hour approach on National Forest land, across a steep, choked tributary to Wolf Creek, then up and to the southwest to a likely looking jumping off point by approximately 1330.Scott offered me the honor of first lead, which I to accepted. I opted to leave my new bolt kit on the ground as the possibilities for protection on the first pitch looked good. I headed up on solid but dirty 5.6-5.7 terrain and placed a couple of secure cams roughly ten and 15 feet off the ground. The climbing for the next 40 feet remained easy on solid-seeming rock that gradually got more thickly covered with lichen as the angle rolled off to a ledge where I intended to belay. My two pieces of protection in this interval were small cams (the last, I think, was a 0.5 Trango cam), but they were the only placements I could find and were in two short, flaring, downward facing cracks, maybe 25 and 35 feet off the ground.Despite sensing that the last piece was just “psycho-pro,” I moved up another five to ten feet onto lichen-covered footholds as the angle of the rock face slackened. I over-committed to one of these untested footholds and it popped off. I slid, pulling out my top two placements. My right leg struck the ledge that made the stance for the first pieces of protection and I flipped end-over-end, striking my helmet. I believe the top two pieces of protection (which failed), and the strike on the ledge absorbed some of the energy of what amounted to a fifty-foot slide/tumble.When I came to a stop maybe ten feet down the steep slope from the base of the rock, Scott was below me urging me not to move. My only obvious and serious injury was an open tib/fib fracture. A self-evacuation was out of the question. My injury, coupled with the late hour and the steep/choked nature of the surrounding terrain, necessitated a technical rescue involving outside resources.We tried several times to get a cell phone signal with no luck. Before Scott hiked out to summon help, he applied traction and supported my leg as I moved in a crab walk to a more level spot and on top of a rope tarp. He used my plastic latrine trowel and gauze and cling wrap to improvise a splint. Scott then made sure I had put on all our spare outer-layers including a stocking cap under my helmet. I loaded up on Ibuprofen and settled in to feed, hydrate, and watch the clock. Scott left me at 1510. By 1545, he had retraced our approach, flagged down a passing motorist, and caught a ride to a house to place a call to 911.Members of the Little Canada Fire Department were familiar with the terrain and responded within a short time, meeting Scott back at the trailhead to where he had returned. The whistle I keep in my shell helped the first member of the Jackson County Rescue Squad on rappel to find me quickly. The incident commander sent another squad member and a paramedic down the same line. Rescuers outlined the options being planned above. Although the Rescue Squad was trained and equipped for a haul up the cliff, complex terrain with loose rock and interspersed with heavy vegetation combined with the late hour caused the incident commander to request the aid of a helicopter.At 1810 the heli-team was overhead, performing a recon/assessment. Two team members lowered through the forest canopy and directed the ground-based rescuers in packaging me for hoist and transport. By 1845 I was transferred into a ground ambulance at the Jackson County Airport. In the final assessment my injuries included a highly comminuted pilon fracture of the tibia, an open fibular fracture, a cracked calcaneous, and chipped patella. I sprained the medial and lateral cruciate ligaments and scuffed the meniscus in my right knee.AnalysisWhile the technical difficulty of the rock I encountered was within my ability, I should probably have pushed up through the grades a bit more before turning my attention to unexplored rock. I would also have benefited from more frequent repetition of my leading skills. My complete lack of experience in establishing new routes also contributed to the length of my fall. I did not clean the features in which I placed protection and I left our bolt kit on the ground.Probable factors in this latter decision include unfamiliarity with use of the hand-drill, and a reluctance to place bolts from stances near what “looked like” good natural protection. In retrospect, I should have down- climbed and retrieved the bolt kit. Also, I could have prevented the fall by being more methodical in testing my foot placements before committing full weight to them. (Source: Scott Philyaw)"

PW, a local guide, spoke with Keith, who described himself as an experienced lead climber at Stone Mountain, NC, an area notorious for long run outs and steep friction. According to PW, Keith was carrying a “Yosemite style rack” (a bandolier which was FULL of assorted gear). PW gave Keith route beta and even held in his hand the specific cams that Keith needed to protect the route. PW relates the rest of the incident: “I didn’t really watch him climb, as I was instructing beginners at the base of Peregrine (a climb adjacent to the Nose). The time was about 3:00 p.m. I heard the unforgettable and unmistakable sound of someone falling—scraping and bouncing down the mountain! When I looked up, it seemed that he was falling from either Peregrine or the new rappel line or possibly the top of the mountain, as his speed was considerable. I noticed two people at the lower rappel anchor. I was afraid that he was going to hit, or come close to us at the base of Peregrine. When he was approximately 50 feet from the ground, he began being pulled towards The Nose and came to rest with his feet approximately four feet off the ground! He never lost consciousness but was stunned and disoriented. It seems a miracle that his injuries were not more severe, especially since he wasn’t wearing a helmet (Keith suffered a fractured right leg and head injury). He was also very fortunate to have such a skilled group of people in the vicinity (a doctor and EMT were in the area, probably the climbers PW noted on the lower rappel anchor).“I am afraid that (due to his position on the rock) he may have been climbing below and to the right of the ramp in an effort to reach the lower rappel anchor on Peregrine, as I’m sure that he could see the two climbers there. All of this in spite of the fact that I gave him clear directions to climb the white streak/ramp on the Nose.”The rescue squad was on the scene in just under an hour. He was carried out via litter and transported to the Pisgah Center for Wildlife Education (fish hatchery) to a waiting helicopter. He was evacuated to Mission St. Joseph’s Hospital in Asheville, NC.AnalysisLooking Glass offers climbers steep terrain and limited fixed protection, thus requiring climbers to be familiar with placing gear. Stone Mountain (an area familiar to Keith) is not as steep and almost all protection is fixed. Keith may have benefited by having a better knowledge of the route and placing gear.

Ben and I were familiar with the area, and our plan was to introduce Noah and Carson to bouldering outdoors, so we focused on moderate problems. The weather was warm and clear. After climbing one problem, I got on Short Crack (V2). The landing area was flat, with no rocks or roots, and we placed several crash pads. Because the problem was short, I decided not to top out. Instead I dropped about four to five feet onto a crash pad, but I landed on the outside of my right foot, dislocating the ankle. Ben was able to support my shoulders when I dropped, so my head never hit the pad. I was able to reduce the dislocation and elevate it on a log while the rest of the group finished a couple more problems, then I walked out slowly. The swelling really kicked in on the drive home. Later that night, I was unable to support my weight and could not walk for the next day and a half. I visited an orthopedic specialist who took an X-ray and confirmed that I had dislocated and sprained the ankle. It took me six months to fully recover. (Source: Anna Marie Alewine.) ANALYSIS One takeaway from this incident is that you don’t have to be climbing a big or difficult objective to get into trouble. In my case, I was doing an easy boulder problem with a flat, well-padded landing zone. You can “play it safe” and still get hurt. Assess the landing area before climbing and make a mental image of where you plan to land. Though not a factor in this accident, careful pad placement can prevent landing on an edge of a pad, as can adjusting crash pads to follow a climber as she moves, especially on problems that traverse.

We started with Comatose (5.8), followed by an unnamed sport climb (5.9). After completing both climbs we elected to do Bunky’s Rest Day (5.8). Neither of us had done the route before, but based on the topo and rating, it seemed to be a route that I could easily climb. The topo shows twin cracks leading straight up to a slab, then moves out to a bolt (5.8). From this point the route moves up and right to a second bolt, then over a small roof and on to the anchors. The total climb to the anchors is 150 feet. I racked up, John put me on belay, and I headed up the twin cracks. The climbing to start isn’t terribly difficult (5.6), with tricky but ample gear placements. After 50 feet I plugged a finger-size cam and moved out to the first bolt. I clipped the bolt at a ledge and took my first assessment of the upper part of the route, which wasn’t visible from the ground. At this point I realized the route gets more serious. From here I could barely see the second bolt. Moving between the first and the second bolt definitely takes you through a no-fall area, because the farther right you climb, the more likely you become to fall directly into the gully, which has several ledges and trees that could definitely cause injury. The second bolt featured another nice rest area with a small ledge and good handhold. This was a good area for another risk assessment. From here, bailing was very easy; I could be lowered to a rappel station in the gully, or could elect to rappel off the single bolt (which clearly had been done before as there was a quick-link attached to it). I took a look up the next part of the climb, which involved moving up the slab, pulling the small roof, and then climbing an undetermined distance to the anchor. I could see the roof had several cracks underneath to provide good gear, and the distance to the roof was pretty short. On my way to the roof, John let me know that we’d reached the center mark on the rope. I was able to move through the roof with a solid undercling, allowing me to get my feet high and reach up for a crimpy hold. Looking up after the roof, I noticed what appeared to be a thin crack no more than 10 feet above, but still no anchor in sight. From here I made the decision to climb the crack, place some gear, and then make another decision. The climbing was definitely a bit tougher, composed of slab moves with poor handholds. Once at the small crack, I realized just how thin it was and placed a Black Diamond C3 (size 0, green). From this point there was no anchor in sight, which meant I was now probably 120 feet up (or 30 feet from the anchor, per the topo). I took a quick look around to find my next point of protection and couldn’t find anything. From what I could tell, the route flattened out about 15 feet from where I was, and I assumed a few more feet took you to an anchor. Given that I’d placed a solid piece of gear, I continued up, looking for the anchor. Immediately after the green cam the climbing got tough—frankly much too tough for a 5.8 climb. I found myself using dime-thick crimps and smears for several moves. About 10 feet out from the green cam, I was still balanced precariously with no anchor in sight, and at this point had no ability to downclimb back to the green cam. I looked left and noticed that if I could move slightly up and left, there was a ledge and some reasonable handholds—in all likelihood the correct route. I moved higher and found myself in a funky position with my left hand and left foot matched on a foothold, right hand on a sidepull, and right foot effectively off the wall. I tried to move more weight onto my left foot, but got nowhere. I was 15 feet above my last piece, and I’d climbed myself right into a place where I couldn’t go up and I couldn’t downclimb. I attempted to shift my weight, my left foot smear couldn’t take it, and off I went. Sliding feet-first down the slab. I quickly reached the 0 cam and continued over the roof. After I cleared the roof, the rope began to tighten, and eventually I came to a stop right atop the last bolt I’d clipped. I was effectively lying face-down on the slab, with no weight on my feet and thankful that the fall had stopped. I did a quick personal assessment and tried to get on my feet. That is when I realized I hadn’t escaped this fall unscathed. The pain was immediate. On a 1-to-10 scale, this was a 10, easily the most intense pain I’d ever felt, and I realized that standing was not an option. I yelled down to John that I was OK and just needed a minute to collect myself. I attempted to put a little more weight on my right foot, then tried my left foot. Neither was going to work. My back was also in pain, but I had full feeling in my legs, could move everything around, and realized the back injury was just a large bruise from where the harness had come tight. I told John that I couldn’t put any weight on either of my feet, and that my back had some pain, but otherwise I was good. Given my situation, location, and gear, John and I decided that he would lower me to the rappel station. He began lowering, and when I arrived at that last bolt that I’d clipped I told John to hold up. I unclipped my alpine draw, figuring the more slings I had the better. The rest of the lower was relatively easy, although definitely not pain-free, as I was using my hands and my knees to keep myself off the wall. I arrived at the rappel station with 10 feet of rope to spare (whew!), sat myself upright on the slope next to the tree, rigged a tether (using my cordelette and a locking carabiner) to attach myself securely to the tree, and told John I was safe and to take me off belay. I quickly rigged a rappel with a backup, tossed the rope down, and away I went on a butt-sliding rappel down a gully thick with vegetation. After another 50 feet or so, I arrived 10 feet left of where I’d started the climb and safely on the ground. Estimated time since the fall was about 30 minutes. Getting down was the easy part—getting to the car was a whole different ball game. Three of John’s friends, who had been climbing nearby, offered assistance. (If you think climbers aren’t a supportive group, you’ve clearly not met the right climbers.) One of them, an EMT, immediately began taking off my climbing shoes and gave me some ibuprofen to help deal with the pain. The scramble down to the main trail wasn’t without its pain and awkwardness. As I slid on my rear end, I think I managed to roll over every stump and pointy rock on the trail. After about an hour we arrived at base of the main trail, and three hours after leaving the rock we reached the parking lot of Rumbling Bald. At the hospital in Charlotte, I was diagnosed with a left calcaneus fractured in three places and a fractured right talus bone. The orthopedist thought that in four to five weeks my right foot should heal enough to allow weight to be placed on it, and that my left foot would take around 10 weeks to bear weight. Analysis I got lost on a route that I’d never climbed, and that the guidebook didn’t describe in detail. This is a risk I accepted then and accept now. Getting off-route happens, and falls happen. In this case, if I had gone left from the last piece of gear, I would have found easier climbing, likely would’ve made it to the anchors just fine, and would’ve climbed a few more routes that day. Having the ability to self-rescue was good. (Source: Mike Best.) "

The below-freezing temperatures created a variety of great ice climbing opportunities throughout the western part of the state.)Around 3:00 p.m., my partner TS and I were finishing our second ice route of the day in the Black Mountain Range. Both routes were characteristic of the long gully climbs—easy to moderate ice with a few technical stretches no harder than WI3. I was beginning the last of the roped pitches, a short 30- foot section of relatively easy WI3. I had placed a good screw just off the belay, and then placed a second one five more feet above. I encountered a short section of neve near the end of the pitch which felt secure, although warranted some delicate climbing. To protect the top-out, I placed a third screw in the best ice I could find, knowing that it was not very solid but hoping it would be better than nothing. The angle lessened considerably at the top of the pitch, transforming into a flat ramp that continued towards the top of the mountain. After making a few more moves past the vertical section, I stepped up high to plant my left foot flat into the ice and finish the pitch using my tools as canes on such low-angle terrain. I planted the bottom of both tools into the ice and committed my weight onto my left foot when it skated off the ice, pitching me off backwards in a head-first fall. I remember the last screw failing as I fell and could see the ledge below me coming closer and closer. I hit the ledge with my head and shoulder blade, bounced, and continued to slide 20 more feet down the gully until I came to a halt. By the time I stopped, I had fallen 40 feet, dislocated my left shoulder, and stabbed my right knee with my crampon during the fall. TS came down to help me out and managed to reduce my shoulder. He pulled all our gear and helped me bushwhack several hundred feet down the ridge to our packs and walk the remaining miles back to the truck.AnalysisMore so than climbing on rock, ice climbing takes keen judgment and the experience to know what is happening with the ice and what techniques are and are not safe. A contributing factor to my fall was rushing the pitch and wanting to get off the mountain after a long day. If I had continued to climb the pitch in the standard manner of planting the picks of both tools firmly before making a move instead of hastily resorting to a more efficient technique, I might not have fallen. Also, if I had not been wearing a helmet, I might not have lived to tell this tale. (Source: Brandon Calloway - 28)"

On December 19, Jesse Watson (32) and his partner EC (31) were finishing their day by climbing Feelin’ Good (5.10a), a 50-foot, five-bolt sport route. Jesse was leading and had clipped the first three bolts on the route without difficulty. At the fourth bolt, he struggled to clip and kept dropping the rope. At this point, he knew he “was going to fall” and noted that he was high enough on the route that a ground fall was not expected to be an issue. He lost his grip and fell approximately 30 to 35 feet to the ground. He was not wearing a helmet. His belayer, using a Grigri Plus, had given him slack to make the clip and was unable to pull in the slack and arrest his fall before he impacted the large boulder beneath the climb, hitting feet first. (The rope didn’t catch him until he came to rest in a seated position.) A paramedic, Jesse did a quick self-assessment and found an open fracture of his left tibia/fibula and a suspected fractured right ankle. ANALYSIS Jesse described what he had learned from this incident: “I think what it ultimately came down to was complacency. I am very comfortable leading 5.10 sport, and my partner and I had become too comfortable with the fact that I don’t fall. I usually climb pretty fast, so I had requested extra slack from my belayer so as to not get hung up. The additional slack for the clip, the distance my belayer was standing from the face due to the boulder below the route, and fatigue were all factors in this accident. I was not wearing a helmet and was extremely lucky to ‘walk away’ with the injuries I did.” When belayers position themselves anywhere but directly under the climb, it’s not just the climber at risk—the belayer can be pulled into the wall by the forces of a fall, causing serious injuries. When the topography forces you to belay more than a few feet away from an ideal position, consider a ground anchor. (Sources: Jesse Watson and the Editors.) &nbsp; ANOTHER GROUND FALL AT MELROSE: In August, a climber experienced a ground fall on a route next to Feelin’ Good.

Late in the afternoon on Saturday, June 7, Lisa Bacon (31) and Brian Sakofsky (35) fell approximately 60 feet from the Tree Ledge while rappelling the south face of Stone Mountain. Both sustained life-threatening injuries. Bacon was taken by an Air Care helicopter to Wake Forest Baptist Hospital, in Winston-Salem, while Sakofsky was taken by ground. ANALYSIS Park officials, along with members of the Carolina Climbers Coalition, conducted an investigation to determine the cause of the accident. This involved examination of the accident scene and inspection of equipment. The climbers were not interviewed.&nbsp; Lisa’s harness was attached to the climbing rope by a locking carabiner through the belay/ rappel loop and a partially finished figure 8 knot tied to that carabiner. The rope had been cut a few feet above the knot, apparently by&nbsp;rescue personnel. This configuration suggests the climber was not tied into the rope while moving around on the Tree Ledge before attaching it to the locking carabiner. Her harness also had a belay/rappel device and a nut tool attached to the gear loops. Because the rappel device was not attached to the rope or in a position to be used, it is unlikely she was preparing to rappel at the time she fell. There were no slings or carabiners attached to her harness that would indicate that she was clipped in or able to be clipped in to a fixed anchor.&nbsp; Brian’s harness was severely abraded on the leg and waist loops, most likely from sliding down the lower angle rock below the Tree Ledge. There was a personal anchor system (PAS) girth-hitched through the belay/rappel loop, a very typical set-up for clipping into anchors. The rope was not attached to Brian’s harness. An additional 48-inch sling was doubled over into a 24-inch length and clipped to the PAS with two locking carabiners. The absence of a carabiner on the end of the 48-inch sling or the PAS suggests the climber was not clipped into an anchor at the time of the fall, nor was he immediately ready to do so. One possible scenario is that Brian intended to wrap the 48-inch sling around a tree or rock and use that as anchor, but the sling likely would not have reached around the tree closest to where the fall occurred.&nbsp; The top of the Entrance Crack, at the right end of Tree Ledge, was the most likely location from where the climbers fell (based on where they landed and what&nbsp;information the rangers had). There were no signs of an anchor on the tree at the top of the Entrance Crack, nor in the surrounding area, indicating the climbers were not secured at the time of the accident. A two-bolt anchor is located approximately 15 feet above and climber’s left of this tree, but no gear was found attached to it.&nbsp; Based on the investigation, both Brian and Lisa were likely preparing to rappel or lower from the large tree located at the top of the Entrance Crack. Brian has stated that Lisa was going “over the tree” when she slipped and fell down the face, and he fell while trying to grab her. If this is accurate, this suggests that Brian likely was going to use the tree to assist in lowering Lisa, who was apparently anxious to be on the ground. Lowering a climber is fairly standard practice, however typically the rope would be passed around the tree and secured to the climber being lowered while both climbers were safely anchored to the cliff. Neither climber appears to have been anchored.&nbsp; The Grigri found with Brian’s equipment was closed and attached to a locking carabiner, but not the rope, suggesting that Lisa was not on belay while moving around the tree. It is likely that Brian was preparing to put Lisa on belay when the accident occurred.&nbsp; The two-bolt anchor near the accident scene is located on a small, flat ledge and is easily accessible—it is one of the primary means of descent from the Tree Ledge. The anchor location is not easily visible from above, due to the angle of the rock, but is visible when looking back up the cliff from the tree. The climbers’ 70-meter rope would have reached the ground from these bolted anchors. The climbers appear to have been unfamiliar with the area and the descent options.&nbsp; In conclusion, this was an avoidable accident, with safer descent options being readily available. Most likely a combination of anxiety and a lack of appropriate edge awareness resulted in Lisa losing her balance and falling down the face. If Brian tried to grab her from his position at the top of Entrance Crack, it is easy to see how he could have lost his balance or been pulled off by her weight.

The climber clipped the second bolt from the ground and then began to pull up on the belay strand of the rope while I pulled in slack. I heard a metallic ping sound and watched the climber fall. I dove off a ledge to take up slack, and the climber came very close to a ground fall, but ended up with only some abrasions. The dogbone on the quickdraw had somehow detached itself from the carabiner clipped to the second bolt. I went up and retrieved the carabiner and it looked normal, and the dogbone looked A-OK as well. My only conclusion is that while the climber was going hand over hand up the rope, he inadvertently shifted the draw into a kind of “back clip” position in which the nylon dogbone could open the gate of the carabiner and work free. (Source: Anonymous belayer.) ANALYSIS Stick-clipping is a great way to protect the opening moves of a climb or to get a top-rope up on a hard sport climb so you can work out the moves. But this also can create an illusion of safety, and it’s important not to be complacent about clipping bolts or double-checking the results. When climbers opt to stick-clip the second bolt of a route, it’s a good idea to clip the first as well, as backup. (Source: The Editors.) &nbsp;"

Local climbers noted that Lloyd avoided rappelling, and he was also known to do a lot of roped solo climbing. Lloyd was careful about building anchors, but could be too casual around cliff edges. He suffered extensive trauma in the fall. Analysis State park rangers found Lloyd during the conduct of a hasty search after his van was found in the parking lot when the park had closed. He was wearing a climbing harness and hiking boots. His climbing pack was found at the top of the cliff, zipped shut and neatly organized. It contained his climbing shoes, some climbing gear, and water. A 70-foot climbing rope was attached to his harness with a Grigri. Tied above the Grigri on the climbing rope was a double-loop figure-of-eight knot. The rope was attached to a doubled 50-foot rope (25 feet in length) that appeared to be prepared for an anchor with a locking carabiner and a double-loop figure-of-eight knot. The opposite end of the 25-foot anchor line had a double overhand loop tied into it. It was not attached to any anchor point. The investigation by state park personnel and experienced climbers was unable to identify a specific cause for this tragic incident. Climbing alone has many drawbacks. This is one of them.

He was with a group of EMS/Firefighters from Forsyth Community College (NC) when he fell to the ground below.The instructor, Mike Maher, also a witness to the accident stated that the group of ten students had just completed the instructional section of their training when Russell was beginning to rappel. According to Maher, Russell “panicked” as he went over the cliff edge, lost control, and fell approximately 40 feet to the rocks below, landing head-first.Two members of the group went to the parking lot, a short distance away to call 911. Since most of the participants in the group were EMTs or Paramedics, first aid was started immediately. Russell was semi-conscious throughout the incident and was described as “combative” by rescue personnel. Even though he was wearing a helmet, the length of the fall combined with his body weight of 240 pounds caused his helmet to collapse, resulting in a severe skull fracture.He was evacuated by Pilot Knob Rescue through a high angle rescue and transported via helicopter to Wake Forest Medical Center in Winston Salem, NC. He is expected to recover.AnalysisAccording to the Park Superintendent who was on the scene, Russell was not belayed. When the instructors were asked about this, their reply was that they didn’t use one because Russell had rappelled before, and that they were not using any back-up systems for any students.It is standard practice for individuals participating in any organized or sponsored climbing and/or rappelling activity be belayed, either by a separate belay rope (by a prusik loop attached to the climbers leg harness loop), or at the least using a “fireman’s belay.” Being surrounded by a group of EMTs and Paramedics and wearing a helmet may have been the contributing factors that saved Russell’s life.

As she rappelled, one end of the rope passed through her device and she fell approximately 30 feet, hitting a ledge, and then fell to the ground, striking her head. Climbers with medical training were on the scene immediately and were able to perform basic first aid. EMTs arrived on site approximately 30 minutes later. She was conscious immediately after the fall. She had a large head laceration, four missing teeth and two fractured neck vertebrae. She was not wearing a helmet.Multiple witnesses noted seeing JM at the top of the rock face and saw her throw her rope down to rappel. They also reported noticing that the doubled rope was uneven and that one end did not reach the ground but extended only about 10 feet down from the anchors. All witnesses stated that the time between noticing her rope being uneven and when she began the rappel was only a matter of seconds and that no one could stop her before she came to the short end of the rope and it passed through her device.ANALYSISThe climber failed to ensure both ends of the rope were on the ground before beginning to rappel. She also did not tie stopper knots on the rope ends. She had been told by her partner earlier in the day not to set up an anchor unless someone else was there to observe. Another witness watched her set up a top anchor earlier in the day, and although it was set up correctly, the witness said she displayed a lack of safety awareness as she worked at the top of the rock face.It’s apparent that JM rushed the rappel setup and moved quickly onto the ropes. For critical transitions like going on a rappel, take an extra moment to verify everything is correct. In addition, if JM had yelled “Rope!” or “On rappel!” to the climbers below before starting down, this might have given them additional opportunity to warn her. Experienced climbers need to speak up immediately when they observe a technique or behavior that puts a climber in imminent danger.

Jackson was leading the third pitch when he found himself slightly off-route. A hold broke, causing him to fall. Zach was able to control Jackson’s fall, but not before he dropped about 35 feet onto a narrow ledge approximately 200 feet up on the route, sustaining multiple injuries that included a concussion, broken leg, fractured pelvis, tailbone, three broken ribs, and a collapsed lung. Because of his condition he was unable to self-rescue. At this time Zach called me (Wesley Calkins) and my climbing partner Dylan Johnston to request assistance.&nbsp;Because I am intimately acquainted with Shortoff Mountain, I knew exactly where my friends were. When I arrived at the top of Maginot Line, there were three search and&nbsp;rescue personnel on scene. My first interaction with these gentlemen, unfortunately, conformed to every other interaction I have had with them. At their best, they are honorable, well-intentioned volunteers, but they do not spend much time in fifth-class terrain. I asked who was in charge. They didn’t know and didn’t offer me any plan or directive. Fearing for my friend and unsure what these three gentlemen could possibly do for him, I proceeded to set up a rappel to go down to Jackson. At no time did they direct me not to descend.&nbsp;I attached my climbing rope to a tree and rappelled approximately 100 feet on a single line with a Grigri. At this point I built a midpoint anchor for the rappel line and continued another 60 feet to Jackson. Dylan also descended the line and positioned himself about 20 feet above.&nbsp;Jackson was lying in a fetal position. I immediately could tell that he was in a lot of pain. Thanks to my training in technical rescue and wilderness first aid, I began to work. First, I made Jackson safe from falling any farther. I took some gear from his harness and built an anchor about 20 feet above him in a crack system. I secured Jackson to the anchor with his rope. I began assessing and monitoring his condition. I knew that I would not be able to extricate him from the cliff on my own. I knew from his condition that time was a factor and we needed to get him to advanced medical care as quickly as possible. And I knew that the terrain above would not allow for an efficient raising system. I made cell phone contact with people on top of the cliff and incident command. I gave patient assessments and guided the rescuers where to place their ropes to reach the victim. I tried to be as precise and as helpful as possible.&nbsp;Poor Zach had been down there belaying for hours. I swapped Jackson’s rope out for my own, so that Jackson and I were secured by my rappel line. Then I directed Dylan to bring Zach up on the original climbing rope and get him off the cliff. Plus, I knew that I needed to get off the cliff eventually, so I also told Dylan to be ready to belay me up once the rescuers had taken over. I busied myself with Jackson, knowing that I had a belay no matter what the rescuers did or didn’t do.&nbsp;I made several phone calls to communicate Jackson’s progress, so it is difficult to remember when I was first instructed to leave the scene by incident command. However, no one seemed to have a problem when I responded that I would leave the ledge as soon as someone from the rescue squad arrived to care for Jackson. It never occurred to me that they actually wanted me to abandon Jackson without handing him off to a rescuer. I deduced that the incident commander was not on scene, because I could not fathom a directive that instructed me to leave an injured person.&nbsp;When the first rescuer finally arrived, the rope was too short to reach the victim. It dangled 20 feet above our heads. The rescuer didn’t know how to communicate his predicament to the people upstairs. He was doing the best he could, so I carefully directed him on how to use my climbing rope to rappel the remaining distance to reach Jackson. Once I had him on the ledge, he took out a massive first-aid kit, and once I saw him reach down and touch Jackson I didn’t feel anything but gratitude, admiration, and relief. Thank God, I thought.&nbsp;The first thing the rescuer told me was incident command wanted me to leave the scene. Jackson moaned some feeble protests, but I responded by saying that definitive care had arrived and that I needed to let the rescuers take over.&nbsp;But the rescuer had transferred to my climbing rope during his descent, and&nbsp;Jackson was still tied to it as well, and both of them were anchored to the crack system 20 feet above their heads. I honestly didn’t think the rescuer understood any of this very well. I was reluctant to leave and I wasn’t sure how or when he expected me to vacate the ledge. It sounded like more rescuers were on their way, along with a helicopter. It never occurred to me to prusik the line, and the need for my immediate departure was never relayed to me. I told him that I was planning to climb out as soon as they could free up my climbing rope. But they never did. So I simply attached myself to the anchor that was 20 feet away. At the time, it felt like the safest thing for me to do was to wait there.&nbsp;The helicopter eventually arrived, hovered near the cliff to assess the situation, and then lowered a rescuer with a basket to the ledge.&nbsp;The two rescuers began packing the victim for extraction. Another paramedic was lowered out of the helicopter and attached the hook to the basket and lifted Jackson away. Then the helicopter lifted away the other two rescuers and I was all alone. I pulled up the now empty rope end, tied in, called up to confirm my belay from Dylan, cleaned all the gear, and climbed with Jackson’s rack, my rack, Jackson’s pack, and my pack.&nbsp;When I arrived at the top, I wasn’t greeted by rescue personnel, thanked, cared for, or supported. Instead, I was detained by a U.S. Forest Service ranger. He was visibly upset with me and my partner over the situation. I was emotional and more than slightly irritated. The ranger instructed me to hike down the mountain with him. During the two-mile hike, I managed to explain the entire situation that afternoon, and the ranger agreed that something did not sound right—he said that he had been called to the scene to detain a belligerent civilian who was interfering with a professional rescue.&nbsp;The silent, indifferent eyes of all the rescuers at the trailhead helped me understand what had happened. I believe my actions, my critical thinking, and my decisiveness had embarrassed the search and rescue team members. I had inadvertently robbed them of some pride. The ranger pulled me aside and said, “Look, I admire what you did up there, but I have to do something here, because they are expecting me to arrest you. I’m going to write you a citation for disorderly conduct and you shouldn’t worry about it. It’s not a criminal citation, it’s just a fine. If you pay it, it disappears.” Believe it or not, I was grateful. If he had just believed everything the rescuers said, I would have been in jail. As it was, I was free to get in my car and leave, a gesture for which I am immensely grateful.ANALYSIS&nbsp;Many times in western North Carolina, you have to run out a pitch—or you may choose to run it out because of your comfort level with the climb. However, any number of things can happen while climbing—including breaking a hold, like in this incident—and protection should be placed conservatively to mitigate the risk of huge falls.

Johnson (26), and D. Jones (28), were climbing Cowboys and Heroes (5.7), a 40-foot route in the Foreign Trade Zone area. Hall was leading the route and fell from a harder variation near the top of the climb after he weighted his highest piece and it pulled out. In the resulting ground fall, Hall suffered open fractures of the tibia and fibula on his right leg, a laceration to the left leg, and a fractured sternum. Hall described what happened: We arrived at Pilot Mountain around 9:30 a.m. and got on a trad climb to warm up, and followed with some top-roping and projecting two 5.10s. Around 11:20 a.m., we moved to a new area and I decided to attempt to onsight Cowboys and Heroes. I placed my first piece at around 10 feet in a horizontal crack. The next 10 feet of climbing leads to a ledge 18 to 20 feet from ground. The second placement was a blue number 1 TCU, also in a horizontal crack. I tested this piece by grabbing the sling and giving it two quick jerks. The final portion of the climb has a number of finishes. Rather than take the 5.7 finish as I had intended, I started working up a vertical crack (5.10). At this point, with my feet approximately 25 to 30 feet from the ground, I started to get pumped. I placed a clearly&nbsp; under-cammed (tipped out) number 2 cam, and as the pump intensified, I began looking for a placement to back it up. While trying to grab a number 3 cam from my rack, my arms began to give out. I grabbed the draw attached to the number 2 cam to help me place the larger piece, but this resulted in the number 2 cam pulling out. As I fell, the blue TCU also pulled from the rock. I fell past the ledge, hitting my left knee on the way down, and landed on the ground with both my feet taking the full force of the fall, before falling backward and coming to a rest on my back and side. One of my partners tried to immobilize me while the other called 911. A climbing guide and off-duty fireman were in the area and reached me within a few minutes. A ranger and Surry County EMS responded to the 911 call, and I was transported to a waiting ambulance. (Sources: Michael Hall and Pilot Mountain State Park ranger Jesse A. Anderson.) ANALYSIS Hall noted: “I believe that not placing additional gear, climbing on rock that had moisture and was dirty, and not staying on route were the factors contributing to my fall. By downclimbing five feet or so [to regroup], I may have been able to prevent the fall. Luckily, I was wearing a helmet. A life-changing accident can happen on an easy climb as quickly as it can on a hard one.” Many climbers opt to top-rope the traditionally protected routes at Pilot Mountain because bands of poor rock exist throughout the climbing area. In addition, the routes are often quite short, making a ground fall a real possibility when cam or nut placements fail. (Sources: Michael Hall and the Editors.) &nbsp;"

E., set out to climb The North Ridge, a 5.5 trad route on Table Rock. The three had arrived the night before and this was the first route of the holiday weekend. The area was busy, since much of the mountain was closed to climbing during the falcons’ nesting season. A second group, with two adults, P.M., E.W., and three children, had earlier set up a top-rope, anchored at the end of The North Ridge’s first pitch, about 130 feet into the climb. A third group arrived, C.T. &amp; K.T., and after speaking to M.E., they decided to climb a nearby route, White Lightning. This third group reported a sense of frustration about how long the second group had been top-roping this trad route.The decision was made that Donnie, Som, and M.E. could safely lead The North Ridge, while the top-roping continued. Donnie led the first pitch. He then belayed Som up to the ledge. Before M. E. cleaned the route, a man from the second group, P M., climbed to the anchors on his top-rope. M.E. then cleaned the route. There were now four people on the ledge.It was somewhat cooler and windy on the ledge compared to the base. Som was cold and wanted to get down to get her jacket and warm up. The fixed anchors on the ledge consisted of three pitons with static line, equalized to a master point. Concern was raised as to the safety of rapping down on just these points. P.M. offered to let Donnie, Som, and M. E. rappel off of his top-rope anchor, which was already set up. Everyone agreed. Donnie backed up the three pitons with a cam. While Donnie and P.M. were setting up the rappel off of the pitons, Som and M.E., along with P.M. whose anchor it was, were preparing the rappel from the top-rope anchor. While all of this was happening, the leader from the third group, K.T., had arrived at the ledge and was bringing up his second, C.T. Several people on the ledge mentioned later that there was a lot of talking, “chatting about whatever.” It was very distracting, but no one said anything about it at the time.What exactly happened next is in dispute. We know that the two ropes were tied together in order to make the long rappel to the ground. Either M.E. handed the ropes, already tied, to P.M. who placed them in the carabin- ers, or P.M. passed one rope through the carabiners to M.E. who removed the rope from the carabiner, tied them together, and then placed them in the carabiners. Either way, the ropes were placed into the carabiners. Donnie tossed the ropes over the edge. They caught on a ledge below. Usually Donnie would have pulled them up and tossed them again, but he figured Som could just toss them over when she got there.Som put the ropes through her ATC and attached them to her harness with a locking carabiner. She asked that another locking carabiner be placed into the master point. (There was an unused locker hanging nearby). It was placed into the system, next to the other carabiners. Donnie now believes that Som thought there was something not right about the anchor, but wasn’t sure what it was. While she was an experienced climber, she relied on help from more experienced climbers to set-up the ropes and to double-check her.M.E. checked the carabiners and made sure they were locked. M.E. offered Som an autoblock, but she declined, saying she never used one. Som unclipped her safety line. M.E. stopped her and had her re-clip and test the set-up before rappelling. She re-clipped and weighted the ropes. Everything seemed fine. She unclipped her safety line and began her rappel.Som descended, first walking backwards and feeding out rope down a long slab. She then bounced on the ropes trying to feed them through the ATC. When she got to the end of the first slab and weighted the rope fully, there was a “pop” sound. Som went over backwards, hit her back on the slab below, slid down the slab and over the edge. The entire rope followed her.In the chaos that followed, great attempts were made by climbers on the ledge to keep everyone safe and get them down as quickly as possible. Donnie descended first, followed by M.E., P.M., C.T., and after pulling the last of the gear, K.T. descended on the three pitons.E.W. was on the ground with his kids when the accident occurred. He ran over to Som and held her. She was not breathing and had no pulse. When Donnie arrived, he began CPR, but to no avail. Climbers at the bottom called 911, and nearby Boy Scouts ran to the parking area to meet them. Checks of Som’s equipment revealed no problems. Her harness, rappel device, and ropes were all connected correctly. She was wearing a helmet. AnalysisThe rappel rope was set up incorrectly and the mistake was not caught when checking the system prior to rappel. After the two ropes were tied together using an overhand knot with 18-inch tail, they were improperly placed in the anchor system. We believe that both ropes were placed in the carabiners together with the knot and tail on one side of the anchor carabiners and both ropes coming out of the other side. The ropes were therefore never actually connected to the anchor system. Som was very cold and anxious to get down. This was clearly a factor in her ability to properly assess the system set-up.When the system was checked, the locking carabiners were pinched and then locked. Som weighted the system and it held her. Now if the carabiners are locked and when weighting the rope it holds you, you would think all is well and proceed on rappel. However, Som was standing on a slab and weighed only about 85 pounds. Therefore, only a small amount of weight was actually placed on the system during this crucial check. The checks that were completed were typical checks on a system prior to rappel. Som proceeded on rappel and when her full weight came on the system at the edge of the slab, the knot pulled through the carabiners and released the ropes she was rappelling on.There were four people involved in the rappel set-up. All were experienced climbers, including Som. There was no single person in charge or second person responsible for checking the work of the first. M.E. thought she was just checking P.M.’s set up since he was there before her, and it was his top-rope anchor. P.M. thought M.E. was setting everything up the way she wanted and didn’t have the chance to check the system before Som began her rappel. Donnie didn’t feel right about the whole anchor situation, but didn’t say anything about. He focused his attention to backing up the pitons and setting up the second rappel. There were two climbers between him and Som. The activity level on the ledge was high. There was a lot of talking about the gear as well as general chatting. This was very distracting and most of the climbers on the ledge believe this to be a very important factor contributing to the accident.In addition, the safety routine established by Donnie and Som, which was always followed, was not followed on this day. As a rule, a heavier climber always went first and Som rappelled after in case she needed assistance. She went first on this day. As a rule, Donnie always set up the rappel and double-checked the system before anyone went anywhere. On this day, other experienced climbers took that responsibility.The error made when setting up the ropes was missed when checking the system. A critical visual inspection of the rope attachment should have revealed the misplaced lines. The long tail most likely contributed to the confusion, as it appeared to be set up correctly. In addition, a physical trace test was not performed. Physically touching and tracing the rope through the closed system would allow the climber to notice any part of the rope placement that was not where they wanted it. (Checking the anchor and harness can be done using a similar tracing method.)Remember that everyone involved was an experienced climber. Mistakes can happen to anyone. Be careful. Check and double check each other thoroughly and retrace the system. Don’t rush. Limit distractions. Take care when altering your set routine. (Source: Jill Machniak-Gallagher.)"

The incident started when the lead climber (LC) was 65 feet above the large traverse ledge located on the third pitch of the route, when he suddenly found himself unable to climb upwards (he was climbing on double ropes). He yelled to his belayer (B) who was positioned on the ledge, with no response. LC then yanked on the rope to get B’s attention, again without response. LC looked down and saw B lying face down on the ledge. LC rapped down, and found B regaining consciousness with blood on his face. His head was ok as he was wearing a helmet. LC secured his partner and with 70m of additional rope rappelled to the ground and made his way to the trailhead for help. On his way out, LC ran into climbers Gary and Carol on the Jonas Ridge trail. Carol left the area to call for assistance. Both the North Carolina Outward Bound School and Burke County EMS responded.In the meantime, LC and Gary walked to a position on the rim of the Amphitheater almost directly across from the route Daddy, where Gary was able to make brief verbal contact with B. After making contact with B, both LC and Gary traversed east around the top of the Amphitheater in worsening weather (by now it was raining hard) to the top of Daddy. Gary rappelled down to the ledge to assist B only to find him gone! All that remained on the ledge was the belay anchor high in the crack and a cut rope. Gary ascended his rope back to the top of the climb.Because of the heavy rain, B became concerned about hypothermia and took matters into his own hands; he rappelled to the ground and climbed the fourth class descent gully out of the Amphitheater where he was eventually met by a member of the hasty team. He was able to walk out of the area unassisted.After two CAT scans and retrospectively putting the clues together, B believes that he was struck by lightning. In trying to piece together the incident, he remembered that one of his shoes had been blown off his foot.He also had a blistered left foot, blackened toes, and remembers hearing a “popping” sound before going into unconsciousness. He said, “Last time I heard that sound, I was close to a lightning strike.”AnalysisAfter putting the clues together, B hypothesized that he was zapped by what a friend described as a phenomena known as “ball” lighting. It apparently exhibits buzzing sounds but no flash and precedes storms. Late day thunderstorms are a common summer occurrence in North Carolina. Climbers can prepare themselves by getting an early start and recognizing the signs of a potential thunderstorm. Familiarization with the appropriate tactics and techniques to help mitigate potential lightning strike will also be helpful.During the quick hike to the top of the route, I (Gary) began thinking that many of my partners and my own self-rescue skills have become rusty or lost due to disuse. I urge all traditional climbers to learn, practice, and keep these skills current. As climbers, we should be capable of rescuing ourselves or other climbers and not rely solely on local rescue services. The North Carolina Outward Bound School, however, is consistently competent and should always be contacted in the Linville Gorge area as they are one of the primary SAR groups in the vicinity. Their support that day is appreciated, as is the quick response of the Burke Co. EMS.

The group leader moved the students under the shelter of an overhang. While waiting for the rain to stop, one of the teenage students reached up and grabbed a rock at head height to do a pull-up. The rock broke and came down on him and another student. Neither student lost consciousness or showed any signs of head trauma, but one stated he was unable to walk. Both students were carried out as a precaution, and the eventual diagnosis was pelvic fractures for one student and a bruised leg and hand trauma that required surgery for the other. ANALYSIS When working with groups, it’s important for the leader or guide to familiarize himself or herself with the climbing site, including potential hazards associated with any staging area. Although this is one of those incidents that would have been almost impossible to predict, it might have been an opportunity to instruct students to test blocks, especially in overhangs, before one fully commits to any hold.

JC was leading Veg-O-Matic (5.7+ or 5.8), a one-pitch trad climb, when he fell approximately 40 feet to the ground. A climber on an adjacent climb observed the fall and called in the incident. He stated that JC was pulling the final overhang (and crux) of the route, just before reaching the fixed anchors, when he fell. A finger crack–size cam pulled out, failing to stop his fall. Emergency medical services arrived at 2:40 p.m. The patient was able to answer questions about his name, day, time, birthday, and location but did not remember what had happened and continued throughout the rescue to ask how far he had fallen. Responders and park visitors began the carry-out at 3:24 p.m. JC was carried in a Stokes basket up the Ledge Springs Trail and then hauled with a pulley system up to the summit area. Here, he was placed into an ambulance. (Source: Pilot Mountain State Park and Mountain Project.) ANALYSIS Ample protection is available on this climb, suggesting the leader did not place enough pieces to prevent a ground fall when his cam pulled out. Small cams require experience for solid placements and should not be the sole piece preventing a major fall. It is not known if the patient was wearing a helmet. (Source: Aram Attarian.)"

MT began the second pitch by moving right approximately 15 feet. After placing a blue Metolius TCU, she continued up, slotted a nut between a block and the wall, pulled up, and in the process dislodged the entire block, causing her to fall approximately 25 feet. The sharp, heavy block (100 pounds or more) struck her lower left leg. Luckily, her attentive belayer was able to arrest the fall.&nbsp;T’s shin was bleeding heavily and one of the ropes was cut to the core. She was lowered to the ground and was able to walk unaided the first 2/3 mile to the car. Her partner supported her the last 1/3 mile.ANALYSIS&nbsp;According to MT: “We were climbing on half ropes, and four out of the seven core strands and the entire sheath of one rope was cut. The other rope was fine and arrested my fall. As far as I can remember, I was falling at the same speed as the dislodged rock. When the rope finally arrested my fall, I was pulled up into the rock (which is how I got numerous, deep lacerations on my lower left leg and ankle). After the rock crashed past me, I smashed into the rock facing outward, with my butt and upper thigh area sustaining huge bruises and small cuts. My left calf was cut open and ended up swelling twice the size of my right calf.&nbsp;My advice to other climbers: Learn how to place solid gear and always inspect the quality of the rock. Testing this placement could have prevented my accident. I didn’t expect a rock the size of a 1980s microwave to move!

All four had&nbsp;significant gym climbing experience. However, this would be their first time climbing outdoors on a multi-pitch&nbsp;trad route. The four divided into two teams, with the first starting up the route at approximately 8:30 a.m. They carried limited rock protection and insufficient clothing and water (all of their water was gone by 1 p.m.).Both parties completed the first pitch without too much difficulty, although moving slowly. The second pitch presented some route-finding challenges for Pair 2, causing them to downclimb to the start of the pitch and start over. Both parties met at the top of the second pitch late in the day. By now it was getting dark, and the group had only two headlamps among the four climbers. Pair 1 was able to complete the exposed finish of the climb with no difficulty, and they left a rope along the route to guide Pair 2 to the top. However, this rope was not secured and when Pair 2 pulled on it, the rope dropped and no longer showed the way. In darkness, Pair 2 attempted to continue but could not find the correct route. One of the climbers was cold and exhausted and refused to continue.Pair 1 waited on top until well after dark before calling 911, in hopes that Pair 2 would be able to finish. Due to the distance and wind, Pair 1 lost voice contact with Pair 2, and they did not feel comfortable downclimbing to Pair 2’s location. Pair 2 stayed on the large ledge at the top of pitch two and waited for rescue. Rescuers arrived sometime after 11 p.m. Once voice contact and a visual on Pair 2's headlamp was established, a single rescuer rappelled directly to them. Pair 2 had an anchor with three well-placed cams and was secured behind boulders in an effort to get some relief from the wind. Clothing, water, and food were provided. Both individuals were uninjured but tired and frustrated with each other. Rescuers atop the cliff set up a 3:1 haul system to assist the two climbers up the final pitch. The climbers were raised individually, taking approximately 30 minutes apiece. Assisted by rescuers, all the climbers then walked back to their vehicle. (Source: James Robinson.) ANALYSIS The 5.4 rating may have enticed these climbers to this route. Although the climb may be technically easy, the challenges of a tricky approach, route- finding, rope management, and traditional protection would make this a big step for climbers who are exclusively gym-trained. Finding an experienced mentor and/or building experience on shorter routes are more appropriate ways to venture onto new types of terrain. This incident is also a good reminder to carry adequate food, water, clothing, and headlamps for longer routes, even if you expect them to go quickly. (Source: Aram Attarian.)&nbsp;"

Both climbers reached the top of the 110-foot first pitch. Once the anchor and belay were established, Lin took the lead. The 90-foot second pitch moves right off the belay and follows a quartz dike to a bolted belay. Lin described what happened next: “I became unintentionally off route and...tried to make my way back to the intended route, but the protection below was suspect. I got to a point where there was not very good protection about two feet below the dike. Here, I had placed a Black Diamond C4 cam (0.75) about knee height, but I knew it was not an ideal placement as I had only three lobes engaged. I stalled and thought through what I was going to do and decided to reach for the next hold. Unfortunately, I fell. The BD .75 popped and I continued to fall. As momentum continued to carry me, the next piece, a number 3 C4, came out. [The next piece], a nut I placed, ended up catching my fall.” Lin fell approximately 100 feet. During his fall, he tumbled a couple of times and in the process struck his head, damaging his helmet. “Catherine was able to arrest my fall and immediately called my name, but I was unable to respond. After approximately five minutes of contemplating our situation, she decided I needed medical attention after noticing blood coming from a lacerated ear. Thankfully, she had cell service and made the call to search and rescue. Because she knew our exact location, rescue personnel were able to reach us in approximately 60 minutes.” One of the first to arrive on the scene was Karsten Delap, a local guide and Transylvania County Rescue Squad member. He was able to climb to Lin and found him conscious. He secured and stabilized Lin and did a primary survey. During the survey, Delap noted a lacerated left ear, bloody nose, and a possible head injury. Delap was able to tandem-rappel with Lin to the ground. Transylvania Rescue Squad members were notified and requested the Mountain Area Medical Airlift helicopter (MAMA) for transport to Mission Memorial Hospital in Asheville. Once rescuers arrived to aid Lin, Delap ascended to Chee and tandem-rappelled with her to the ground, where she was treated for mild hypothermia. ANALYSIS Lin commented:(1) Guidebook: I own two North Carolina guidebooks and researched the route,and truly thought I was going the intended way. Unfortunately, once I realized I was off route, it became incredibly difficult to get back on track. (2) Weather: The day that we went climbing, there was still some snow on the ground from snowfall earlier in the week. That day in particular was also relatively cold (mid-40s F), and it is reasonable to think that in the darker parts of the wall with no sunlight that it was slicker than normal. (3) Gear Placement:This goes along with the first item:Because I was a little off route, the gear placement was less than ideal, with suspect rock. (Source: The Editors.) &nbsp;"

I had placed four pieces in the first 30 feet, got to a small traverse, and then placed two additional cams (1 and 0.75 Black Diamond), both of which were super-secure in a nice crack directly underneath the cams that blew. Careful placement of gear (especially small cams) along with doubling up pieces when placements are not ideal can help prevent dangerous falls. (Source: Peter Magnin and the Editors.)"

Upon arriving at the hospital, the climber was diagnosed with a fractured temporal bone and cerebral hemorrhage in the back of his head. He was not wearing a helmet. (Source: Hanging Rock State Park.)ANALYSISThis route is about 100 feet high, so lowering with a 60-meter (197-foot) rope would provide no margin for error. Although the precise circumstances are not known, ropes shrink with age, making it possible the climbers’ rope was shorter than believed. It’s also possible that the method the climber used to thread the anchors for lowering used up significant amounts of rope.This type of incident continues to be a problem at climbing areas across the country. These accidents can be prevented by closing the belay system, which can be done by: (1) Both climber and belayer tying into the rope; (2) Placing a stopper knot on the end of the rope; and/or (3) Tying the belayer’s end of the rope to an anchor or rope bag. And, always wear a helmet. (Source: The Editors.)"

Two climbers, Riley Collins and Jay Massey, were preparing to climb Dopey Duck when they witnessed Howell fall at around 11:30 a.m. Neither can say for sure what route he was on, but most likely it was in the Tilted World, an area of very steep 5.10 and 5.11 pitches, since his pack was found a couple of days later on top of that zone. Collins stated that, moments before falling, Howell yelled “NO ” After witnessing the fall, Massey reached the fallen climber and began CPR. At 1:18 p.m., rescue crews arrived at the top of Shortoff Mountain, and a first responder reached Howell soon afterward. He could not be revived. ANALYSIS Howell was known to record himself climbing, and on this day his camera filmed the entire incident. Investigators were able to view the video and observed that he had both hands on the rock when his foot slipped. He tried unsuccessfully to regain his footing on the overhanging climb and fell. Free soloing is inherently dangerous, with no room for error, even for the most talented and experienced soloists. Massey should be praised for his response. He arrived at Howell’s side within minutes of the fall, stabilized his position so he didn’t slip further down the slope, and initiated CPR until he was asked to leave the scene by dispatch.

The climber was a strong and competent, but new to the area. I watched him easily climb Nuclear Crayon (5.10c R) and Quakerstate (5.10d/11a). After onsighting both he started Stab in the Dark (5.10d).He pulled the boulder problem off the ground (placing one piece of gear along the way) and climbed up under the low roof about 15 to 20 feet off the ground. At this point there is a crack under the roof where gear can be placed prior to traversing left around the arête to gain the crux crack sequence. He placed a nut and a yellow Alien under the roof, both clipped to the same sling. After attempting to get established around the arête and place some gear, he decided to retreat to the nut/cam placement and asked his belayer to “take.” As soon as he weighted the gear, both pieces pulled and he fell to the ground, landing flat on his back. It looked like a very hard fall. The three of us in the Amphitheater ran to help. Long story short, he had a small cut on his back, got the wind knocked out of him, maybe a sprained ankle, and an injured tailbone. He decided he was okay and was able to walk out on his own. Analysis The horizontal crack under the roof starts out very uniform on the right. Near the left side, where one pulls around the arête, the crack has a narrow opening and slightly widens deeper inside the crack. I believe this is where he had the gear, and had placed a cam that was too small for the crack. It was likely the right size for the opening, but too small once beyond the constriction. The cam inverted (breaking the trigger wires), and the second piece (the nut) was not sufficient to take the weight. The last piece was too low to do anything. This is a good lesson to make sure there are two solid pieces between you and the ground or a ledge. Climbing with new people, new gear (the gear was not his), and in a new location might have contributed to this incident. (Source: C. Sproul, from a post on Mountainproject.com.)"

Huneycutt successfully led the first pitch to the Crow’s Nest belay ledge. Apple began the second pitch, but was unable to negotiate a roof section. It was becoming dark and the pair decided to retreat. Apple left some gear under the roof so he could retreat to the Crow’s Nest. From here they were able to rappel to the ground. Before leaving the area, they decided to retrieve the gear they’d left behind. They scrambled to the top of the route and set up a rappel with their 70-meter rope. Apple descended over the roof and then realized the doubled rope (with rope ends knotted) was too short to reach the Crow’s Nest. Huneycutt noted, “All of a sudden he says, ‘I’m at the end of my rope, literally’.... I really got scared at one point where he was able to touch the rock wall and was able to stand up. I felt the weight go off of the rope and yelled down to him, ‘Are you still there?’” The confused communication caused Huneycutt to call rescuers and say he and his climbing partner were stranded on Moore’s Wall, when in fact Apple had already begun a self-rescue. Apple executed a leg wrap with the remaining rope to halt his rappel and was able to retrieve the gear left behind. Using the equipment he had with him (mostly slings and carabiners), he was able to ascend the rope more than 100 feet, taking approximately one hour to rejoin Huneycutt. They met rescuers as they were walking out the trail. (Sources: Will Apple, news reports.) ANALYSIS Climbers should familiarize themselves with descent routes and equipment requirements before attempting an unknown descent. A second rope would have been helpful in this situation, along with a headlamp. (Apple was able to use his smartphone as a light source.)

The patient was not wearing a helmet, but said he did not hit his head and had not lost consciousness. He had an open fracture (already bandaged) to the right tibula/fibula and possible fracture to the left tib/fib as well as the left ankle. Once other rescuers arrived, we transported the patient to the trailhead via wheeled Stokes basket. Fox Mountain Guides provided steep-angle belays on the trail when necessary. Care was turned over to flight medics, and the patient proceeded&nbsp;to the landing zone in an ambulance.ANALYSIS The climbers had planned to set up a top-rope from Stage Ledge on Looking Glass’ South Side. They scrambled to the ledge, built an anchor using two cams, and one of the climbers proceeded to lean back on the rappel. At this point, the climber stated, he felt the knot at the master point slip, hold for a second, and then he started to fall. I took photos of the scene at the base of the route and on top. When the climber hit the ground, his rappel rope was still threaded through the device clipped to his harness. Two locking carabiners, still locked, were clipped to the rope. On top, two nylon slings that were tied together to extend toward the lip remained connected to the anchor. At the other end was an overhand knot forming a loop. The evidence shows that the climber attempted to tie a BHK (Big Honking Knot) for a master point. Tied correctly, this overhand knot creates two bights of webbing or rope to provide redundant material at the master point. However, it is possible to tie the knot incorrectly and create a slipknot that looks similar but will fail under load. Check your knots before trusting them!

Byers was leading the route Balcony (5.5). Witnesses mistakenly reported that he had reached the top of the climb and that one of his anchors pulled, causing him to fall. The witnesses reported he fell about 60 feet, striking his head against the rock several times. His rope prevented him from hitting the ground, leaving him on a ledge 10 to 15 feet up. He was not breathing and did not have a pulse when paramedics reached him.ANALYSIS&nbsp;In an attempt to shed some light on the event, Bradley Woolf, Robert Hutchins, and I met with park staff to examine the scene. The park had collected some of Mark’s belongings, including his harness (cut by rescuers), his Soloist self-belay device (still secured to the belay loop), his chest sling (cut by rescuers), and the section of rope&nbsp;that was trailing from his harness. Rescuers cut his rope to extract him. Tellingly, there was an overhand knot proximal to the cut end of the rope. This suggests that Mark’s Soloist did not engage during his fall and that the backup knot is what prevented him from falling to the ground.&nbsp; We accompanied park staff to the climb and found no signs of broken gear at the base. Looking up, we could clearly see an intact anchor at the first-pitch belay ledge for the Balcony (about 50 feet up) and a rope tied there and extending up the cliff to an unseen high piece of gear. From the unseen gear the rope descended to a point about 15 feet above the base (some distance below the belay anchor). At the cliff top there was no sign of damage to the existing bolt anchors, and there was no sign that Mark had in fact even reached the top.&nbsp; Bradley and I rappelled to inspect Mark’s high piece. Approximately 40 feet from the lip we found an intact number 7 stopper clipped into the rope with a sling. This is the piece that held Mark’s fall. We rappelled down to the anchor we had seen from the ground. It consisted of two 0.5 Camalots and a pink Tricam equalized with a cordelette. There was a red Tricam hanging from the anchor, but not a part of it. We agreed that this was a directional or an early piece of gear placed as Mark led out from his belay anchor. This placement likely failed due to a lateral pull from the rope as Mark fell, but had little bearing on the distance he fell. Above the red Tricam we found a sling girth-hitched around a rock feature. This sling was still clipped into the rope. From here the rope was clipped into the previously described high gear. Above the highest piece the route steepens and pulls through a bulge. We found fresh chalk here, but no sign of broken rock.&nbsp; After our site visit, our group felt very confident the accident was not a product of gear failure but rather the result of an inverted fall that caused the Soloist self-belay device to fail to engage. It is highly likely that while pulling the bulge Mark fell into an inverted body orientation. It is also possible that falling with the rope behind his leg could have inverted Mark. Either way, falling upside-down can cause the Soloist device to fail to engage, a possibility the former manufacturer warned users about.&nbsp;Rescuers report that Mark’s airway was compromised by a chest sling he was wearing and that this was likely the proximal cause of death. Pictures that Mark took during a prior ascent show a red sling configured such that the tie-in point was in the center of his chest (secured with locking carabiner). This effectively creates an X across the front of the chest, which could ride up in the event of a fall and impact the victim’s airway.&nbsp;In summary, site evidence and the knot in the rope suggest that Mark took a leader fall while climbing through the steepest part of the route. This fall was not arrested by the Soloist, probably because of his body orientation. Once the fall was stopped by the backup knot, Mark’s chest rig rode up on his torso to the point where it impacted his airway. Perhaps due to his injuries, Mark was unable to right himself&nbsp;and take weight off the chest sling. (Source: Eddie Medina, Carolina Climbers Coalition.)&nbsp;[Editor’s note: The Soloist belay device is no longer manufactured. Climbers who still use this device must be aware that it is only designed to catch a leader falling in a relatively upright position. Consider appropriate backups.]"

Prior to start...","On October 5, an organized college group divided into two parties to expedite climbing the Daddy (500 feet, 5.6). The first group (A) summited and then hiked out to the parking area. Prior to starting, the groups had agreed that if the second group (B) didn’t make it to the parking area by 10 p.m., the first group would go back and look for them. At approximately 6 p.m., while following the last pitch, a male climber (25) fell about 15 feet onto a pyramid-shaped rock, landing on the back of his right knee and lower thigh. He was the last climber in a group of eight students and instructors who had previously topped out. Around 10 p.m., Group A returned to look for the second group, and while en route they received a text from Group B reporting that there had been an incident with injuries. About the same time, a call was made to Burke County SAR indicating that an injured climber was stranded near the top of the Daddy. The over-all group leader (who was with Group A) descended to check on the injured climber, before reascending and making contact with search and rescue. A Burke County SAR member and Burke County EMS Special Ops medic arrived at the informal trail above the Amphitheater and made voice contact with the patient, who was about 90 feet below the top. The rescuers immediately requested further high-angle rescue resources. The weather was wet, foggy, and chilly, with a breeze of about 10 mph. SAR member James Robinson rappelled to the patient and found him partially covered with a plastic poncho and cold and wet. Robinson assisted the climber out of his wet layers and into a warming bag with heat packs. A tarp was used for shelter. The climber had sustained a muscular injury to the upper right leg that prevented him from bearing weight. Both rescuer and patient were anchored to the wall and spent the remainder of the night on the ledge while resources were assembled. The patient’s leg was splinted. In the early morning, rescuers performed a 3:1 hoist, with Robinson ascending a fixed line alongside the patient to keep him from impacting the rock face. The injured climber was assisted to the parking area and evacuated to a local hospital. ANALYSIS The final pitch of the Daddy requires intentional gear placements and an attentive belay to protect the second. A combination of factors contributed to this climber’s relatively long fall and injury: 1) an inexperienced belayer, 2) slack in the rope, 3) the climber’s weight (approximately 250 pounds) and a narrow rope (8 9mm), both of which would have increased rope stretch, and 4) haste due to approaching darkness. Climbers venturing into Linville Gorge Wilderness should carry enough equipment to spend the night. This group did not have the necessary gear or clothing for night- time exposure, nor enough food or water, and this affected their decision-making.

The route begins from a ledge approximately 60 feet up an adjacent wall; to reach the start, climbers ascend easy 5th-class terrain on the Egg Wall or the Sentinel Chimney. On this day, both of the usual approaches were soaking wet with runoff. However, the climbers noted a large dry streak on the Egg Wall, along or near a seldom-traveled route known as Scrambled Eggs (approximately 5.6). Above them, Break on Through was almost completely dry and judged to be climbable. &nbsp; Climber 1 led the pitch to the ledge and built a solid belay anchor. Climber 2 was following the pitch, approximately 30 feet off the ground, when he reached a rounded fin of rock that he needed for a handhold to clear a small overhang. The hold appeared to be an integral part of the wall, but since it was clear that the recent rains had loosened some holds, Climber 2 tested it by partially weighting the hold overhead and bouncing with his body weight. He felt some movement in the rock, tested it again, and felt no further movement—since he was on easy ground, he judged it was safe to continue. As he moved off his stance, the rock gave way and a piece approximately 14 inches square and weighing about 25 pounds hit him on the head (he was wearing a helmet), knee, and finally on the top of his right foot. Despite his foot injury, Climber 2 was able to traverse about 50 feet to a rappel station on an adjacent route, protecting the traverse using the gear on his harness. Climber 1 followed the improvised traverse, and then both climbers rappelled and hiked out. An urgent-care visit and X-ray diagnosed a fracture of the first metatarsal. (Source: Climber 2.) ANALYSIS Substantial wet weather or freeze-thaw cycles may cause seemingly solid holds to work loose. These experienced climbers understood the potential impact of heavy rain on the variable quartzite at Moore’s Wall; they altered their usual approach to avoid wet rock, and they tested suspect holds. After feeling the hold move when he tested it the first time, the climber might have tried to find an alternative line to avoid committing full weight to this hold. Yet this might have led him onto other seldom-climbed terrain, with other loose holds. “It’s easy to forget at popular areas, where the classics have 40 years of traffic and little loose rock, that wandering even just a few feet off the beaten path can lead to a first-ascent-like experience, in terms of rock quality,” Climber 2 said. “We often free solo a clean and well-traveled easy section of this wall as an approach pitch, so it’s tempting to treat the whole wall as a foregone conclusion. That led to a case of experienced climbers not adjusting expectations to current conditions.”&nbsp;(Source: The Editors.) &nbsp;"

Starting at the base, the four scrambled to the top of the cliff and walked to the observation tower on Moores Knob, where they placed a number of cell phone calls. From here their plan was to rappel from the top of Sentinel Buttress to a ledge called the Crow’s Nest, approximately halfway down the feature. According to Addison, Mitchell was going to be the first to rappel. However, it was decided that Eric would descend first, since he was the most experienced and familiar with the terrain. Eric set up the rappel, and during the process Mitchell noted that one rope end hit the Crow’s Nest rappel station below. He also noted that he and Eric had talked about tying a knot in the end of the rope, but did not remember Eric pulling up the rope to do this. Eric rappelled out of sight from the other three. According to group members, Eric used the “two bolts at the top with the chain,” which was a “solid anchor” and that it “looked safe.” After Eric started to rappel, Mitchell heard the rope zipping, then observed the end of the rope as it ran through the anchor. The three then heard a loud thud. Mitchell leaned over the ledge and saw Eric lying face down on the Crow’s Nest Ledge below, heard him moan, then roll over twice. The second roll sent him over the edge. All three heard a second thud as Eric landed at the base of the Sentinel Buttress almost 200 feet below. All three made their way back to the Moores Knob observation tower to call 911. Ian descended to Eric. Addison and Mitchell hiked the Moores Wall Loop Trail to the campground, where they called 911 a second time. They waited there until picked up by a Hanging Rock State Park ranger. In the meantime, Ian reached Eric, checked his pulse, felt a heartbeat, and began chest compressions, heard a crunching sound, stopped briefly, and continued compressions for approximately 10 minutes, then checked for a pulse. He then attempted rescue breathing but had trouble getting the breaths in, commenting that Eric’s lungs were full of blood. He stopped CPR and ran down the trail to meet responding state park rangers. Both rangers attempted CPR and were unsuccessful. Paramedics arrived, and use of a defibrillator indicated no heart activity. Eric was pronounced dead on the scene. (Source: Hanging Rock State Park.) Analysis The Sentinel Buttress rappel anchor is located close to where the Sentinel Buttress route (5.5) finishes. The anchor, consisting of two bolts with hangers, swaged cable, and quick-links, is located just below the edge of a large, flat ledge. It is relatively easy to reach to the anchor, clip in, and then step down onto a small stance beside the anchor. The rappel is normally done with a 60-meter rope. From this stance, one rappels approximately 30 meters (98.4 feet) to the Crow’s Nest Ledge. This rappel starts as free-hanging, but quickly becomes less than vertical, eventually descending over large ledges. When rappelling with a short rope, one has to downclimb some low-angle, fourth-class terrain to reach Crow’s Nest Ledge. Once reaching the Crow’s Nest Ledge, the climber makes his way about 15 feet north toward Sentinel Chimney and the top of the first pitch of Sentinel Buttress. Here one finds a fixed anchor of static rope wrapped around a large boulder, with rappel rings. From here it is about 85 feet to the ground. Rescuers found a 50-meter rope attached to Eric’s harness and lying completely on the ground when they arrived. Upon inspection, it was noted that a single bight of rope was threaded through the Black Diamond ATC Pro, which in turn was attached to a locking carabiner connected to the harness belay/rappel loop. The rope was measured from where the bight ran through the ATC. One side measured 95 feet, and the other 70 feet 6 inches. A figure-of-eight knot was tied approximately 6 feet 6 inches from the end of the shorter section of rope. No knot was observed on the 95-foot length of rope. Based on this evidence and comments by Mitchell, it as determined that Eric rigged the rappel by running the 50-meter rope through the quick-links. He tied a figure-of-eight knot on one end of the rope, but did not place a blocking knot at the opposite end. When attaching the rappel rope to his harness, Eric neglected to thread both bights of rope through the ATC, as is required for a double-rope rappel. Instead, he placed a single bight of rope through his ATC and attached this to his harness. This proved to be a fatal mistake. In the 2012 addition of ANAM, the opening section “Know the Ropes” provides instruction for rappelling. To repeat some of this: Before descending, do a pre-rappel check by having you and your partner(s) check the anchor and check the ropes to be sure they reach their intended destination, are even, and have blocking knots on both ends. Check the rappel device to make sure it is set up and oriented correctly; check the carabiner gate (locked); and assess the need for a backup. Eric was the only experienced climber in the group, therefore everyone else deferred to him for decisions regarding the rappel. (Source: Aram Attarian.) "

A member of his climbing party had led the climb before him and left the draws in place. The third bolt was clipped with a shortened sling (an “alpine draw”), with which Dylan had no experience. A witness stated that while attempting to clip this draw, about 25 feet up, it appeared Dylan was “fiddling with his sling and carabiner.” He accidentally removed the lower carabiner from the sling and then, when he attempted to reclip it, he did so incorrectly. When Dylan weighted the rope, the lower carabiner pulled free from the sling.Dylan yelled “falling” and his belayer, Alex, initially was unsuccessful at arresting the fall, as he did not have control of the brake strand in his tube-style belay device. The belayer finally gained control, but Dylan impacted the ground in a partially seated position before hitting his head on the ground and losing consciousness. Dylan was wearing a helmet. After a night in the hospital for monitoring, he was released the next day with a bruised tailbone. (Sources: Pilot Mountain State Park rangers and Doug Lutz, Fox Mountain Guides.)ANALYSISWhen used properly, extendable slings can reduce rope drag and minimize the chance of traditional protection pieces pulling out. In this case, the sling was configured properly but used incorrectly by Dylan. Additionally, the belay was inadequate. Had the belayer been paying closer attention, he may have had time to lock off the brake strand before the climber hit the ground. (Source: Aram Attarian.)"

However, he was conscious and alert. After ensuring the patient’s condition was not worsening, Anderson accompanied him on the hike out. Medical assessment revealed a two-to three-inch laceration on the right side of his skull and light rope burns on his leg. Starkey explained to rescuers that he had been lead climbing outdoors for his first time on the route Chicken Bone (5.8 sport). As he was nearing the third bolt, he lost his grip on a hold and fell. His rope was behind his leg, and this caused him to flip upside down and hit his head on a ledge below. Starkey said he was unsure, but felt like he had “blacked out.” He was not wearing a helmet. (Source: Incident Report from Pilot Mountain State Park.) ANALYSIS This climb has been the scene of numerous accidents over the past couple of years, mostly involving inexperienced climbers. Avoid getting your feet and legs between the rock and the rope. A fall in this position may result in the leg snagging the rope and flipping the climber upside down. While many sport leaders pass on wearing a helmet, this accident is a good example of its usefulness. Leading easier climbs can increase the risk for injury, as they often tend to be lower angle and/or have ledges that a falling climber could hit. (Source: The Editors.)"

Climber 1 (male, early 20s) was shirtless with his hands on his head and blood&nbsp;streaming down his head and face. There were numerous abrasions on his torso. I immediately lowered my climbing partner to the ground, and a nearby pair of climbers came over to assist. One of them was a doctor. I retrieved my first-aid kit from my pack and the doctor donned gloves and attended to Climber 1’s head injury. He had a severe laceration on his scalp but seemed alert and responsive. Very eager to get to the hospital, Climber 1 and Climber 2, his belayer (male, early 20s), were still wearing climbing shoes and had left all of their gear behind. My partner and I retrieved their walking shoes and offered to collect their gear while they went to the hospital.The two had been attempting Black Rain, a 5.9 sport route. Earlier in the day, we had climbed the same route, which has six bolts and a large intermediate ledge. Many of the routes that day were wet from recent rains and mist. While we were able to send the route, we struggled to find good stances on the slippery rock, and my hand popped off several times, resulting in moderate lead falls.ANALYSISBased on what we saw when we retrieved their gear, Climber 1’s fall occurred above the ledge while attempting to clip the fourth bolt. Based on his description, he fell while clipping, landed on the ledge and struck his head (he was not wearing a helmet), then fell off the ledge. While cleaning their gear we noticed that several of the quickdraws were not clipped in the safest manner, including one that was back clipped. Overall, we got the sense that these two climbers were inexperienced and did not understand the risks inherent in climbing. Weather and conditions can greatly increase the difficulty of climbs and should always be considered in route choice. (Source: Alexander “Sasha” Timkovich.)"

Miriam led the climb and reached the anchors, where she began the task of cleaning the gear in preparation for lowering. This was the first time Miriam had attempted to complete this transition, and Lawrence stated that he had coached her on the ground on how to clean an anchor safely. Lawrence noted that Miriam spent more time at the top anchors than a more experienced climber would have. She pulled up on the rope multiple times to take her weight off the rope or her personal anchor system (PAS). When she sat back as if ready to lower, she fell approximately 90 feet to the ground, her rope falling with her. She received multiple fractures and other injuries in the fall. First responders stated she was breathing but not responsive. Her helmet was removed to check her pulse, and she was left in the position where she landed until she stopped breathing. At this point she was repositioned and CPR was started. Once paramedics arrived, they determined there was no heart activity and stopped CPR. (Source: Ranger Nicholas Bowman.) ANALYSIS It is believed Miriam used a PAS to tether herself to the anchors. She was found with a figure-of-eight on a bight attached to her belay loop with a locking carabiner and had untied from her figure eight follow-through tie-in knot. This suggests she intended to push a bight of the rope through the anchor and then tie a figure eight in the bight to clip to her belay loop. However, she apparently failed to pass the bight of rope through the rings first. There are a few steps climbers can take to avoid a repeat of this tragic event. First, there should be clear communication between climber and belayer as to what’s going to happen at the anchor before the climber leaves the ground. Second, new climbers can practice threading and cleaning a mock anchor on the ground before doing it at the top of a route. Once the climber is at the anchor, if communication is clear, the experienced belayer should verbally talk the climber through the steps of cleaning the anchor, or the climber can verbalize each step to the belayer for confirmation. And finally, once threaded through the anchor, the climber should make sure they are still on belay before committing to the rope. Have the belayer take the rope tight to confirm the system is working before unclipping the PAS or other tether from the anchor. (Source: The Editors.)"

On February 2, a sunny, bluebird day, we had planned to get on a different route and carried only one 60-meter rope with us. However, when we passed Dinkus Dog (5.10b) and saw that it was available, we decided to give it a go, as it was also on our tick list. We climbed the two pitches of Dinkus Dog to the top, alternating leads. We are both comfortable leading 5.10 trad and had no issues climbing the route. We knew we needed two ropes to rappel from the anchors straight to the ground, but also knew there were convoluted rappel options to get down with one rope. A comment on Mountain Project mentioned a solid tree about halfway up and to the left of the route, and our analysis from the ground confirmed this was a viable option. Once we were at the top, we decided to rappel to the tree and set up a sling anchor there to rappel to the ground. As it was a slightly diagonal first rappel to the tree, we placed a cam about 20 feet to the left of the anchors as a directional, so the rappel line would run straight down to the tree. The plan was that Jed would rappel first to set up the lower anchor. When it was my turn, I could remove the cam and then follow the diagonal rope to his anchor at the tree. We typically simul-rappel, as we are similar in weight, but did not this time. We always tie knots in the ends of our rope, use an ATC with an extension, and use a prusik backup. This rappel was no exception. While our cam placement made the rappel safer from a directional standpoint, it left Jed about three feet short of the tree. I shouted down for him to place a cam and anchor himself to it so I could remove the directional up top and thus release enough rope for him to safely reach the tree. However, he shouted back that he had the situation under control, as he was able to unweight the rope using a small shelf for his feet. His plan was to extend his belay device with a long sling. However, in a lapse in judgment, he also removed his prusik and untied the knots from the ends of the rope, thinking he would need as much rope as possible to reach the tree. Due to the new extension, he couldn’t easily grab the brake strands of the rappel rope. He apparently either lost his balance or weighted the rappel system expecting the back-ups he had removed to hold him. The ends of the rope passed through his device, and I watched him free-fall more than 100 feet to the ground. I thought that he had died and started screaming, alerting other climbers in the area. I also immediately dialed 911 and set a rescue in motion. An amazing community of climbers, including an ER nurse who was first on the scene, was able to stabilize Jed at the bottom. He hit ledges, trees, and brush on the way down and landed on dirt as opposed to the slab. He never lost consciousness and recalls “actively falling.” He was wearing a helmet. Once I heard he did not appear to have life-threatening injuries, I pulled up the rope and saw the knots we had tied in the ends were no longer there. I lowered one end to a climber below, and he tied on a second rope, which I pulled up and then was able to make a single rappel to the bottom. Upon assessing that Jed had no damage to his spine, we carried him from the base of the cliff toward Slick Rock Trail, where we met a rescue team who helped carry him the rest of the way out in a litter. He was airlifted to Mission Trauma Center in Asheville. Miraculously, he sustained only three broken ribs, broken spinous processes, a ruptured right Achilles tendon, and abrasions down his right side. ANALYSIS The accident happened because of a lapse in judgment and the removal of rappel safety backups. It was entirely preventable.&nbsp; Similar accidents can be avoided by never removing these backups and carrying two ropes where necessary to rappel as opposed to attempting convoluted rappel options. [Editor’s Note: An additional consideration is that the climber may have weighted the system without having his hand on the brake strands of the rappel, trusting his third-hand backup to hold him. Although resting on a prusik or autoblock is often useful for cleaning gear or untangling rope while rappelling, it’s safest to do with the rappel ropes held in one’s hand or otherwise secured.

After clipping the fifth bolt, the climber placed a hand under a flake on the left side of the route. Multiple bats flew from the flake, and Simon pulled his hand back to reveal three bleeding wounds, on the middle, ring, and pinkie fingers of his left hand. After asking his belayer to “take,” he lowered to the ground, where they immediately began to irrigate the wounds with clean water. Knowing that bats are carriers of the rabies virus, they hiked out of the gorge and called area hospitals to ascertain which had post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for rabies available. The climber received the full series of PEP over the next four weeks.ANALYSIS Though fairly uncommon, these encounters should be taken seriously. Rabies is a fatal viral disease that must be treated promptly if suspected. Bats are a common reservoir of the rabies virus, and their habitat includes the flakes, cracks, and crevices in climbing areas. If you suspect a bite or scratch by a bat or other mammal that could carry the virus, clean the wound thoroughly with copious amounts of water and/or providone-iodine. Seek medical evaluation as soon as possible, and begin post-exposure prophylaxis if indicated. (Source: R. Bryan Simon.)"

Unable to navigate in whiteout conditions at 10,600 feet, he called 911 on his cell phone and requested assistance. Despite the low visibility and high winds, rescuers from Portland Mountain Rescue reached him about 10 hours later. During this delay he placed numerous calls to friends, even texting a message to a Facebook page. Later communication attempts by SAR managers to facilitate Kish’s rescue failed because of his dead cell phone battery. Analysis Climbers should not rely solely on cell phones to initiate a rescue. In this event, the cell phone (and automatic GPS data transmitted, via E911) was instrumental in rescuing Kish successfully Climbers using cell phones for emergencies should limit calls and conserve battery life. This may include placing/answering only critical calls, following instructions from SAR managers, following a predetermined call-back schedule, and leaving the phone turned off in between calls to save the battery. Phones also need to be kept warm and dry to maximize battery and display performance. (Source: Jeff Scheetz, Portland Mountain Rescue.) (Editor’s note: In June 2012, the Oregonian and OregonLive.com published a list of all fatalities on Mt. Hood since 1848, including ages and circumstances. About 10,000 people attempt to climb the mountain each year. The majority of rescues are for snowboarders, skiers, and hikers, with only about 4 percent for climbers.) "

Wogan placed one piece of protection and followed it with a second piece at 25 feet. He initially placed a cam but then, wanting to save the cam for later, replaced it with a hex. At around 30 feet, Wogan fell but was held by the hex. He did not inspect the hex as he climbed past it a second time, and when he fell again at 30 feet the piece failed to hold his fall. He believes that some of his fall was held by the rope, indicating the belay was as effective as possible. He fell to the ground and onto his back and suffered spinal fractures, rib fractures, a scapula fracture, lacerations, and pulmonary contusions. He was released after a three-day hospital stay.ANALYSISIt is generally beneficial to place numerous pieces in the first 15–30 feet of a pitch or above a ledge. Additionally, it is important to inspect gear after falling on it to ensure that it is still placed securely. It’s not known if Wogan extended the hex with a quickdraw or sling, which may help prevent a piece from being pulled out of position by the action of the rope.

They rappelled from anchors at the Springboard, a prominent ledge facing the Monkey Face, using two 60-meter ropes. These anchors are traditionally used for a Tyrolean traverse or slackline over to the Monkey Face, not for rappelling. When the two climbers reached the top of the first pitch of the West Face Variation, they were unable to pull the ropes due to friction on the rock,and they did not know how to ascend the ropes. The party called 911 for help. Deschutes County SAR arrived on scene, and two members of the Mountain Rescue Team rappelled to the&nbsp;subjects and assisted them to the ground. ANALYSIS It is important for climbers to be able to recognize appropriate and inappropriate anchors for rappelling and to consider the effects of friction when pulling a rope. This party would have been better off walking to the base of their next route. Climbers attempting multi-pitch routes should have the skills and gear to ascend stuck rappel ropes if necessary.

The climbers were members of an “Advanced Rock” class hosted by a local climbing organization. Koran led the fourth and final pitch, placing two small cams before he fell with about 15 feet of rope between himself and the belayer. Both cams pulled out and Koran impacted a 70–80° slab of rock after falling about 30 feet. He was reported to be unconscious for several minutes after the fall. (He was wearing a helmet.) The belayer tied off the belay at the anchor, called 911, and waited for rescue. Rescuers reached the climbers from above, and Koran was lowered approximately 500 feet and taken by helicopter to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with a sprained ankle, minor concussion, and minor injuries.ANALYSISThe injured climber was moderately experienced, with more time in the gym than outdoors, and he was leading a four-pitch 5.10 route that was likely beyond his abilities. His mentor was reportedly a 5.11 climber, but not a certified guide. Both cams placed by the subject failed to hold the fall—one cam’s lobes were folded inside-out in a manner consistent with a cam placement that is too small for the crack. Fall factors are greatest closest to the belayer, and therefore it is advisable to place more pieces in the first 15 to 30 feet of a pitch, especially in locations with consequential terrain below (in this case the slab under the belay). No effort was made to self-rescue. (Source: Matt Crawford, Deschutes County Search and Rescue.)"

The climber (age approximately 18) fell much farther than I would have expected and made contact with a ledge partway up the route. She was lowered to the ground and was clearly in great pain. I went to assist and quickly determined that her ankle was either sprained or broken. We splinted her ankle with an ACE wrap, a T-shirt, and some webbing; my wife grabbed a pair of crutches the state park has cached in the Dihedrals area. We assisted the climber down the trail to the parking lot, where we handed her over to a ranger.ANALYSISNumerous factors contributed to this accident. First, the incident occurred in the middle of the day; the air temperature was about 90 degrees, and the route was in full sun. The heat could have adversely affected the climbers’ performance. Second, it seemed as though there was too much slack in the belay rope. Third, the climbers may have been inexperienced, although their exact experience level is not known. Better knowledge of lead belaying, lead climbing, and the route may have helped prevent this accident, as this climb is generally quite secure. Although it did not affect the outcome of this particular accident, it is worth noting that neither the climber nor the belayer had a first-aid kit or a helmet. (Source: Joe Osterman.)"

High winds, cold temperatures, and icy conditions slowed the ascent. The party summited at 3 p.m., and with superficial frostbite developing, they quickly descended the south side unroped, using headlamps. Two of the male members had previously climbed the route and led the descent. The party spread out, with the female member, age 27, lagging behind. The three male climbers reached the lodge, but the female member descended to the west of the lodge, heading toward the distant lights of Government Camp. The lost climber called 911, which initiated a Portland Mountain Rescue (PMR) call-out. The climber texted a photo of a trail sign, which helped rescuers pinpoint her location. (A screenshot of the subject’s phone showing a GPS location was inaccurate by about a half-mile and was disregarded.) She was located, assessed, and rewarmed by the PMR team and then assisted to Government Camp. Here, an American Medical Response team evaluated her for frostbite and hypothermia, and recommended transport to the hospital for treatment.ANALYSIS Allowing the party to separate during descent was a major mistake, especially given the development of frostbite and hypothermia in the female climber. Her off- route descent was likely due to unfamiliarity with the route and the difficulty of using navigation tools (compass and GPS receiver) due to the onset of hypothermia. Nonetheless, her phone was instrumental to the eventual rescue—a good reminder to keep some juice in the phone battery until you're off the mountain.

He placed a fourth piece (type unknown)&nbsp;and then fell, pulling the fourth piece from the wall. The rope either was not clipped to the cam below or became detached, and the top bolt was too low on the route to keep Kowalczykowski from hitting the ground, after falling at least 40 feet. He suffered a skull fracture and concussion.ANALYSIS Kowalczykowski was unable to describe the placement of the third piece after the incident, but it remained on the route and was examined afterward. The piece had been extended with a shoulder-length sling attached to the cam with a carabiner. A second carabiner, intended to clip the rope, was attached to the cam’s sling adjacent to the first biner, suggesting the climber accidentally clipped the sling of the cam instead of the rope. Whether this mistake was made in haste or because the climber was pumped, he might have caught the error if he had glanced at the placement before continuing up the route. Placing additional pro, at shorter intervals, could have prevented a long fall when the top piece failed. (Source: Matt Crawford, Deschutes County Sheriff’s Office Search and Rescue.)"

He pulled his belayer (42) into him, and the collision resulted in several neck and back compression fractures to the belayer. A SAR volunteer who was hiking in the area at the time of the accident called for help. The call went in at 11:10 a.m., and the SAR team was hands-on with the patient by 12:36 p.m. They assessed injuries and transported the climber to higher-level care. ANALYSIS It’s not uncommon for a belayer to be pulled off their feet and even strike the wall when catching a falling leader. In this case, the belayer was pulled significantly upward because the leader was more than 100 pounds heavier. The pair had reportedly climbed together for years, including many catches of the heavier male by the lighter female. It is not known what made this particular catch so much more significant. One can assume that it was a long fall or that the belayer was positioned in such a way that the forces generated pulled her violently upward. [Editor’s Note: A tool specifically designed to address this situation is the Edelrid Ohm, which is clipped to the first bolt and mitigates the forces generated by a leader that is much heavier than the belayer.] The belayer was not wearing a helmet. The fact that the patient was wearing a climbing harness made maintaining spinal precautions while repositioning the patient into the litter for transport much easier. As a side note, SAR was initially requested only to assist in walking the injured climber to her car, when she in fact had life-threatening spinal injuries.

Rescue teams responded and assisted with the rappel. ANALYSIS Voyage of the Cow Dog does not see the same level of traffic as many of Smith Rock’s routes, and the Picnic Lunch Wall is known for having some poorer rock.

Hood’s south side, about 24 hours after the avalanche on May 31, 1998. (A) The 300-foot crown fracture extended across the whole slope above Crater Rock, varying from one to five feet high. (B) The Hogsback bergschrund, below the Pearly Gates. The incident took place on Sunday May 31 at 10:05 PDT at the 10,700 foot level on the West Crater Rim route. The occasion was a graduation climb for The Mazamas Basic Climbing Education program. The party was caught in a large slab avalanche. The fracture occurred about 200 vertical feet below the westernmost summit ridge near the 10,800 foot level. One rope team of three people were caught and swept down a 45–50 degree slope—through the Hot Rocks area and then the gully between Crater Rock and Castle Crags. One person was killed by trauma during the fall, a second person received a fractured pelvis possibly due to the rope breaking between her and the person killed, and a third person on the rope team experienced a fractured ankle. The leader was also briefly caught in the avalanche and experienced an ankle and a shoulder injury. The avalanche was classified as SS-A0-3 (medium in size relative to its potential path). The crown was 300 feet wide, two feet average depth varying from one to five feet The slope faced southeast and the slide ran from 10,800 feet to the 9,550 foot level, or 1250 vertical feet. The slope angle at the fracture line was 40 degrees. The climbers were engulfed at the 10,700 foot level while traversing a 25–30 degree “ramp.” Stormy, cool weather during much of the preceding week had produced one to two feet of new snow at higher elevations on Mount Hood. Clearing late Saturday allowed sun and rising freezing levels to produce surface snow melt of the upper one to two inches of wind packed snow. Radiation cooling overnight helped briefly stabilize the surface crust. At the time of the accident sun had been warming the slope for about four hours and the air and snow temperatures were rising rapidly. The freezing level was around 10,000 feet. Earlier parties summitted climbing predominantly on the firm crust. However, by mid-morning climbing parties reported knee depth post-holing down to an old crust. When the group left Timberline Lodge, they observed a hand-written sign, posted in the Forest Service Climbers’ Register, stating “HIGH AVALANCHE HAZARD!” The sign had been updated Saturday, May 30 at 8 p.m. by the USFS climbing ranger, only hours before the group set out. It was unusual for such signs to be posted. In fact, this was only the second such sign in seven years. The leader and other party members observed the sign. The wording of the sign caused questions from and confusion among various party members, some of whom who believed it might have been placed the prior week. The party left Timberline Lodge at 12:45 a.m. and reached Silcox Hut an hour later, where the assistant leader turned back because of a preexisting injury. One of the basic school students was promoted to be assistant leader. Progress slowed, and it was over three hours later before they left the top of the Palmer ski lift just as the sun was rising. Getting to the base of the steep slope leading to the ridge overlooking Reid Glacier took a farther two hours. The ascent of the slope, and a rest to let the Hood River party pass, took about two more hours. Snow conditions deteriorated on the ascent of the steep slope and steps were six to twelve inches deep. The slope that avalanched had been in the sun for about four hours at the time of the release. On the ascent, the party passed evidence of recent slides on the west side of Crater Rock, a slope similar in aspect to their intended route. The leader probed with his ice ax and was reassured by the firm footing that the snowpack was stable. No hasty snow pits or strength tests were done. The presence of well over 100 climbers on the mountain and another party from Hood River on the West Crater Rim route also mitigated the leaders’ concern about avalanche hazard. After Crater Rock the party traveled in three roped teams. At the time of the avalanche, the leader was traveling unroped just behind the leader of the first rope. A loud crack was heard as the slab released. Within seconds the descending slab disintegrated and overwhelmed the lead rope team and the climb leader. The two trailing rope teams were not involved in the slide. The leader lost his ice ax but was able to stop before being swept down the 45–50 degree slope. The lead rope team was swept through the Hot Rocks area and down to the gully between Crater Rock and Castle Crags. Two of the rope team were partially buried at the 9,850 foot level, with their rope still attached between them. The third member was completely buried at the 9,650 foot level, the rope having been severed. After dispatching the other rope teams to a safe area, the leader descended the slide path, finding one person buried to his waist and another mostly buried with only her head and arms above the snow. The Hood River party, with two small rope teams and two unroped members were ascending 100–150 feet ahead of the team caught in the slide when the avalanche occurred. This group was on the right (east) flank of the slide. All were just beyond the fracture, except one roped member who was knocked down and carried about 100 feet before his fall was stopped by the self-arrest action of another team member. After this mishap, this party continued to the summit unaware of the nature of the slide they had narrowly escaped. A USFS climbing ranger, on patrol near the Hogsback, and a member of Portland Mountain Rescue organized a rescue team that descended the debris performing a quick visual and transceiver search. Because the two partly buried climbers reported transceivers were not being used, probe lines were organized. The third climber was uncovered about an hour after burial at a depth of four feet. It was apparent that death resulted from significant injuries suffered in the fall. Evacuation of the injured victims was accomplished in about three hours by snow cat to Timberline Lodge. Then the most seriously injured person was flown by Life Flight helicopter to Portland. The remainder of the party descended under their own power without any additional leadership. Analysis Leadership. The leader was one of the most experienced climb leaders serving as a volunteer for the club. He had climbed several times in Peru and the Himalaya, and had summitted Aconcagua. He had climbed the West Crater Rim route about 15 times and Mount Hood over 50 times. He has been chair of the Climbing Committee. The participants were novice climbers who had completed evening education programs and several weekend outings. The Route. The West Crater Rim route is frequently ascended. It has longer and steeper sections than the regular Hogsback route. The leader chose the West Crater Rim route about three months previously, intending to avoid the crowds and leave the Hogsback route for another party. The leader preferred this route because it gave “twice the steep climbing and was more enjoyable” than the crowded Hogsback route. Jeff Thomas’ Oregon High Climbing Guide states: “Be aware that this route is directly in the path of debris falling off Crater Rock, and of any avalanche coming off the slopes above Castle Crags. Huge slides are not uncommon during or right after heavy snowfall, and sometimes in the spring. If conditions are at all shaky, avoid this route.” Transceivers. The climbing ranger commented that most other climbing parties on the mountain that day did not carry avalanche transceivers. Although several people climbing that day owned them, they were left behind. Some of these climbers later remarked that they hadn’t considered avalanches to be a problem as it was late in the season and it was such a beautiful day. But in fact, a secondary maximum in monthly Northwest avalanche fatalities occurs in May, similar to the mid-winter Northwest maximums. Primary causes of the accident: The unusually high hazard avalanche conditions resulting from snow loading the previous week during a storm; an old snow crust beneath the new snow; and rapid warming at the time of the release of the avalanche. The presence of the party on the West Crater Rim route after the slope had been warmed and destabilized by the sun. Secondary factors that contributed to the accident: The slow pace of the party that resulted in them being on the slope after warming had occurred. The leaders’ decision to continue on the West Crater Rim route was not questioned because there was no other leader present with sufficient experience. The severity of the injuries may have been increased by use of roped team travel. The unroped leader was able to avoid being carried down slope, whereas the rope ensured all three students traveled the avalanche together. The pelvic injuries may have been the result of the rope breaking. A confusing warning sign that failed to communicate that the avalanche danger still applied. The disturbance of the slope by the Hood River party and the Mazama party may have weakened the slope however the release may have been natural. Lack of awareness amongst many climbers on Mount Hood that day about the potential for large slab avalanches “even on nice days.” (Source: From a report by the Incident Response Committee, consisting of John Blanck, Al Cooke, Josh Lockerby, Alan Proffitt, Dave Sauerbrey, Larry Stadler, and Ian Wade.)"

With darkness approaching and being unfamiliar with the established rappel route, the party mistakenly rappelled from the anchors at the top of the fifth pitch rather than the fixed anchor on the backside of the northwest wall. After reaching the anchors below, the party was not able to pull their rope, due to the friction of their rope traveling over the face above. They did not know how to ascend the rope and were stranded.

Climbers transitioning to multi-pitch routes need to be familiar with self-rescue skills and techniques not normally needed in single-pitch terrain, including the ability to ascend a stuck rope. Additionally, time management on long climbs is essential; approaching darkness can lead climbers to make hasty decisions. (Sources: Deschutes County SAR and the Editors.)"

Climber 1 (male, age 28) was leading the third pitch of the route. After clipping the third bolt, a foothold broke, causing him to fall approximately 15 feet, hit the belay ledge, knock off a large chunk of rock, and continue to fall an additional five feet before being caught by his belayer. The climber sustained injuries to his left ankle that were later diagnosed as a non-displaced fracture of the talus and calcaneus. Climber 2, the belayer (male, age 35), was clear of the path of the falling rock and escaped unharmed.The climbers were using a 60-meter rope, which was of insufficient length for rappelling to the ground from their location. Climber 2 led the rest of the climb and assisted his injured partner up the remaining pitches to the top, from which they descended by an established rappel route.ANALYSISDespite being friends for a number of years, the two had only climbed together on rare occasions. Prior to the day of the accident, they had climbed for two days at Smith Rock. During this time, Climber 1 reported noticing Climber 2 had a nonchalant attitude toward belaying (e.g. sitting down, excessive slack in the system) but did not express his discomfort with these belay methods. While on Lost in Space, Climber 2 sat on the belay ledge with his back to the Climber 1 and doled out slack at regular intervals without being cognizant of the amount of slack in the system and the climber’s position on the wall. Climber 1 had just clipped the third bolt, above his waist, when the foothold broke and initiated the fall. With appropriate slack in the system, he should have fallen only about five feet.The takeaway here is to speak up if a climber is concerned about the belayer’s technique, including maintaining positive control of the brake strand of the rope, maintaining visual contact with the climber on the wall, and adjusting the slack in the system to avoid ledge falls.

Orr said that Pawelski had fallen about 30 feet while rappelling, and that the two of them were stuck on a narrow ledge about 300 feet from the ground and about 200 feet from the top of the rock face. He advised she was not able to continue her descent and requested assistance.The Deschutes County Sheriff’s Office was notified, and three sheriff’s deputies and 15 volunteers from the Deschutes County Sheriff’s Office Search and Rescue (SAR) responded to Smith Rock State Park to assist the Redmond Fire Department with the rescue. Shortly after 6 p.m., the first SAR volunteers arrived on scene and began the rescue. Two SAR members climbed to the top of the rock face, above the two climbers, and rappelled down to their location, while 13 additional SAR members and fire department personnel hiked to the base of the rock face with additional equipment. Pawelski was secured to one of the SAR members, who did a vertical rappel about 300 feet to the rock base. She was then lowered via wheeled litter about 200 feet, down an approximately 50-degree slope, to the trail. At 9:15 p.m. she was transported across the Crooked River and then via ambulance to St. Charles Hospital in Redmond for treatment. According to an interview that she granted to a local newspaper in July 2013, Pawelski suffered fractures to her skull and right elbow, a concussion, and a spinal fluid leak, resulting in a three-week hospital stay. Analysis Wherever I May Roam (5.9) is an intimidating, 500-foot, near-vertical face climb, fully bolted but requiring an exposed series of rappels with a 60-meter rope to reach the ground. As the victim was not willing to reveal the mechanism of her fall, only speculation remains. Did she miss a bolt and rappel off the end of a too-short rappel rope (without a stopper knot)? Did she rappel past a set anchor bolt/rappel point and try to climb back up to it, falling and losing her grip on her rappel ropes? Did she have a backup? The reader can learn a great deal from a study of “Know the Ropes: Rappelling” in the 2012 edition of Accidents. (Source: Robert Speik, following interviews with rescuers.)"

Hopefully this will engender a humble respect for the mountains.There have been accidents in the past in which failure of hardware has appeared to be a factor. Because of this and to improve service rendered by the AAC to the mountaineering community, an equipment testing program has been initiated. Dr. George Austin has accepted the responsibility of organizing this program. Considerable data of previous studies has been compiled. It is planned to maintain this program on a regular basis and to test items such as pitons, bolts, and carabiners that are offered for sale. The results of such tests will be published as a part of the Safety Report. Persons who have or know of pertinent data should forward the information to Dr. Austin, Department of Neurosurgery, University of Oregon Medical School, Portland, Oregon.Skiing Injuries, Epidemiologic Study, Haddon, W., Ellison, A.

At 1530 the party stopped at the 8,700 foot level when Ms. Klassen decided to take a “short-cut” across a 35 degree snowfield. While descending, she slipped and slid backwards down the snow slope 40 feet, striking her back on a rock. Ms. Klassen was stabilized by members of her party and an Outward Bound group who happened by. She was reached by rescuers the next morning and helicoptered off the mountain. She has since recovered from her injuries. (Source: Jeremy Adolf and Bob Freund, Corvalis Mountain Rescue)"

Keeley climbed 12 meters to the base of the first overlap, finding only two poor chock placements. He reevaluated his position and decided to have one of his two partners throw him another rope from above. As Mike Seasholtz tossed a belay rope from above, Keeley slipped and fell. He pulled out both chocks, resulting in a 12 meter ground fall. His injuries included one broken lumbar vertebrae, a large laceration above the right eye, and numerous abrasions and contusions. Point Pleasant Rescue Squad evacuated Keeley to Doylestown Hospital. (Source: Jim Detterline)AnalysisKeeley, an experienced local leader who has been climbing since 1978, had climbed Triple O numerous times on top-rope in the past. He realized that good chock placements would be difficult to find and decided to abort the lead after concluding that his two placements were inadequate. At this point, Keeley said that he had plenty of strength in reserve to wait for the additional belay from above, but he slipped on the slippery holds. Stover’s popular shale faces tend to be quite slippery during periods of high humidity. In addition, the practice face holds have been worn smooth and caked with sweat by multitudes of climbers. It would have been more practical to have attempted the lead of a better protected route. This incident emphasizes the high risks of short but unexpected falls on poorly protected leads or solos.

Climbing a meter to the right of a top rope, he protected about three meters off the ground. About six meters off, he stopped to protect himself again. After placing a stopper, he stepped up to get a better look at the placement. Meanwhile, the top-roped climber had moved into the same crack and her rope crossed Grout’s shoulder. This distraction caused Grout to lose his focus. Air time! Ground fall. Fractured left heel. (Source: Phillipp Grout)AnalysisAlways clip in, even if you don’t trust the placement. Be aware of climbers around you. And no matter how easy a climb may seem, don’t take it lightly. Stay focused and concentrate. (Source: Phillipp Grout)(Editor’s Note: The other reports we have from Pennsylvania this year include two stranded “climbers” who were cited for disorderly conduct after requiring rescue from an aerial fire ladder. These fellows were on a shale cliff above a pullout on U.S. 209. Another example of how nonclimbers end up proving that climbing is hazardous.)"

I had been climbing for about five years, but she had never belayed a leader. I quickly showed her how to belay, then led the easiest routes, 5.3 to 5.5, and set up top-ropes so she&nbsp;could climb. She had not brought a helmet, so I loaned her mine. At the end of the day, I decided to sneak in something slightly harder but still well within my comfort zone: Dirty Swing, a 5.7 route on the Orange Sunshine Wall.There were a few factors that should have deterred me from attempting this last route, including the fact that I had no chalk, I had only that day taught her how to lead belay, and she is about 80 pounds lighter than me, but I was anxious to get in as much climbing as possible. Without anchoring her to anything, I tied in and started climbing, hardly taking a look up at the route. I made it past the crux and after the last bolt noticed an abnormally long runout before what appeared to be two sets of bolted anchors, one to my left and one to my right. I paused on a tiny ledge about 10 feet up from the last bolt, assessing the options, and the next thing I knew I was falling, probably having slipped on some loose rock. I fell about 20 feet, with my legs outstretched and knees locked, and landed straight onto my left foot on a small ledge. After flipping over, I stopped upside-down a few feet above the ground. My girlfriend had been yanked off the ground and was hanging above me. My left talus had been fractured, with my foot pointing out and to the left at a very gross angle. First responders from Robeson Township drove me out to a waiting ambulance. I now have plates on either side of my ankle, and I wasn’t able to walk for several months. ANALYSIS I disobeyed one of the principles of the Mountaineers’ Climbing Code: “Never let judgment be overruled by desire when choosing the route or turning back.” Despite not having chalk, not knowing anything about the route, and being with an inexperienced partner who weighed much less than me (and was not anchored), I went for it anyway. Midway up the climb, when I looked down and was slightly frightened to see a large loop of rope out from her belay, I simply told her to “make sure to take in some of the slack” and continued on. Also, if I had read the comments on the Mountain Project page for this route, I would have learned of the two anchors and long runout from the last bolt, and known that the left was the one to go for. Finally, I was insanely lucky not to have hit my head. I always wear a helmet, but this day I had loaned it to my girlfriend because of the area’s reputation for loose rock.
