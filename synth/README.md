This project aims to replicate many features of my other music project but with superior separation of concerns
and better development tools


## Setup
probably some 
``` npm install ```


## Running

``` npm run watch ```
and then open the page (src/index.html) in your browser and manually refresh or
``` npm run serve ``` which uses http-server to serve the page
