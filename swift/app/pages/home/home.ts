const raw = `He said the way my blue eyes shined
 Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
 I said, "That's a lie."
 Just a boy in a Chevy truck
 That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
 On back roads at night
 And I was right there beside him all summer long
 And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
 
 But when you think Tim McGraw
 I hope you think my favorite song
 The one we danced to all night long
 The moon like a spotlight on the lake
 When you think happiness
 I hope you think that little black dress
 Think of my head on your chest
 And my old faded blue jeans
 When you think Tim McGraw
 I hope you think of me
 
 September saw a month of tears
 And thankin' God that you weren't here
 To see me like that
 But in a box beneath my bed
 Is a letter that you never read
 From three summers back
 It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
 And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe
 
 When you think Tim McGraw
 I hope you think my favorite song
 The one we danced to all night long
 The moon like a spotlight on the lake
 When you think happiness
 I hope you think that little black dress
 Think of my head on your chest
 And my old faded blue jeans
 When you think Tim McGraw
 I hope you think of me
 
 And I'm back for the first time since then
 I'm standin' on your street
 And there's a letter left on your doorstep
 And the first thing that you'll read is:
 
 When you think Tim McGraw
 I hope you think my favorite song
 Someday you'll turn your radio on
 I hope it takes you back to that place
 When you think happiness
 I hope you think that little black dress
 Think of my head on your chest
 And my old faded blue jeans
 When you think Tim McGraw
 I hope you think of me
 
 Oh, think of me
 Mmmm
 
 He said the way my blue eyes shined
 Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
 I said, "That's a lie."State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
 I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
 So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
 [Album version line:] That's fine I'll tell mine that you're gay!
 [Music video version line:] That's fine you won't mind if I say
 By the way...
 
 [Chorus:]
 I hate that stupid old pickup truck
 You never let me drive
 You're a redneck heartbreak
 Who's really bad at lying
 So watch me strike a match
 On all my wasted time
 As far as I'm concerned you're
 Just another picture to burn!
 
 There's no time for tears,
 I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
 There's nothing stopping me
 From going out with all of your best friends
 And if you come around saying sorry to me
 My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be
 
 [Chorus]
 
 And if you're missing me,
 You'd better keep it to yourself
 'Cause coming back around here
 Would be bad for your health...
 
 'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
 You never let me drive
 You're a redneck heartbreak
 Who's really bad at lying
 So watch me strike a match
 On all my wasted time
 In case you haven't heard,
 I really really hate that...
 
 [Chorus]
 
 Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
 You're just another picture to burn
 Baby, burn...Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see
 That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be
 I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about,
 And she's got everything that I have to live without.
 
 Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's just so funny [radio version]
 Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny [CD version]
 That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
 He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,
 I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
 
 [Chorus:]
 He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
 The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
 He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
 
 Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
 And there he goes, so perfectly,
 The kind of flawless I wish I could be
 She better hold him tight, give him all her love
 Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
 
 [Chorus]
 
 So I drive home alone.
 As I turn out the light
 I'll put his picture down
 And maybe get some sleep tonight.
 
 'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
 The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
 He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
 He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
 And he's all that I need to fall into.
 
 Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see.I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
 Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
 Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
 Trying to see through the rain coming down
 Even though I'm not the only one
 Who feels the way I do
 
 [Chorus:]
 I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
 I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
 Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world
 
 Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
 And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
 Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
 Could you tell me what more do I need
 And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
 But that's ok
 
 [Chorus]
 
 Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
 But I'm ready to fly
 
 I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
 I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
 Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
 Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world
 
 Oh I'm just a girl
 Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh,
 Oh I'm just a girlYou have a way of coming easily to me
 And when you take, you take the very best of me
 So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
 And you do what you want cause I'm not what you wanted
 
 [Chorus:]
 
 Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
 Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say
 And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
 I've never been anywhere cold as you
 
 You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
 And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
 And you come away with a great little story
 Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
 
 [Repeat Chorus]
 
 You never did give a damn thing honey but I cried, cried for you
 And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you
 (Died for you)
 
 Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
 Every smile you fake is so condescending
 Counting all the scars you made
 And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
 I've never been anywhere cold as youI didn't know what I would find
 When I went looking for a reason, I know
 I didn't read between the lines
 And, baby, I've got nowhere to go
 I tried to take the road less traveled by
 But nothing seems to work the first few times
 Am I right?
 
 [Chorus:]
 
 So how can I ever try to be better?
 Nobody ever lets me in
 I can still see you, this ain't the best view
 On the outside looking in
 I've been a lot of lonely places
 I've never been on the outside
 
 You saw me there, but never knew
 I would give it all up to be
 A part of this, a part of you
 And now it's all too late so you see
 You could've helped if you had wanted to
 But no one notices until it's too
 Late to do anything
 
 [Repeat Chorus]
 
 So how can I ever try to be better?
 Nobody ever lets me in
 I can still see you, this ain't the best view
 On the outside looking in
 I've been a lot of lonely places
 I've never been on the outsideSeems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
 Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
 You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
 But that's not true, cause I know you...
 
 [Chorus:]
 Hold on, baby, you're losing it
 The water's high, you're jumping into it
 And letting go... and no one knows
 That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
 That you might not be the golden one
 And you're tied together with a smile
 But you're coming undone
 
 I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
 Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
 Hoping it will end up in his pocket
 But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
 Oh, cause it's not his price to pay
 Not his price to pay...
 
 [Chorus x2]
 
 You're tied together with a smile
 But you're coming undone... oh
 Goodbye, baby
 With a smile, baby, babyCory's eyes are like a jungle
 He smiles, it's like the radio
 He whispers songs into my window
 In words that nobody knows
 There's pretty girls on every corner
 That watch him as he's walking home
 Saying, "Does he know?"
 Will you ever know?
 
 [Chorus:]
 You're beautiful
 Every little piece love,
 And don't you know
 You're really gonna be someone,
 Ask anyone.
 And when you find everything you looked for
 I hope your life lead you back to my door
 Oh, but if it don't,
 Stay beautiful
 
 Cory finds another way to be
 The highlight of my day
 I'm taking pictures in my mind
 So I can save them for a rainy day
 It's hard to make a conversation
 When he's taking my breath away
 I should say, hey, by the way...
 
 [Chorus]
 
 If you and I are a story
 That never gets told
 If what you are is a daydream
 I'll never get to hold,
 At least you'll know...
 
 You're beautiful
 Every little piece love,
 And don't you know
 You're really gonna be someone,
 Ask anyone.
 And when you find everything you looked for,
 I hope your life lead you back to my front door.
 Oh, but if it don't
 Will you stay
 Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
 Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
 La la la
 Oh, oh, oh, oh,
 Oh, but if it don't,
 Stay beautiful
 Stay beautiful
 Na, na, na, na, naIt's strange to think the songs we used to sing
 The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
 Yesterday I found out about you
 Even now just looking at you feels wrong
 
 You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
 It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes."
 
 [Chorus:]
 You should've said "No", you should've gone home
 You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
 You should've known that word, with what you did with her,
 Get back to me (get back to me).
 And I should've been there in the back of your mind
 I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
 You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
 You should've said "No", baby, and you might still have me
 
 You can see that I've been crying
 Baby, you know all the right things to say
 But do you honestly expect me to believe
 We could ever be the same?
 
 You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
 It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes."
 
 [Chorus]
 
 I can't resist
 Before you go, tell me this:
 Was it worth it?
 Was she worth this?
 
 No... no, no, no...
 
 [Chorus]She said, I was seven and you were nine
 I looked at you like the stars that shined
 In the sky, the pretty lights
 And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
 Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
 And rolled their eyes and said oh my my my
 
 Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
 Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
 You never did, you never did
 Take me back when our world was one block wide
 I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
 Just two kids, you and I...
 Oh my my my my
 
 Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
 I wasn't that little girl you used to see
 But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
 And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
 They never believed we'd really fall in love
 And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
 And said oh my my my...
 
 Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
 Two A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me
 Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
 The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
 You stayed outside till the morning light
 Oh my my my my
 
 A few years had gone and come around
 We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
 And you looked at me, got down on one knee
 
 Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
 Our whole town came and our mamas cried
 You said I do and I did too
 Take me home where we met so many years before
 We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
 After all this time, you and I
 
 I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine
 I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
 In the sky, oh my my my...I was riding shotgun
 With my hair undone
 In the front seat of his car
 He's got a one-hand feel
 On the steering wheel
 The other on my heart
 I look around, turn the radio down
 He says, "Baby is something wrong?"
 I say, "Nothing,
 I was just thinking
 How we don't have a song"
 And he says...
 
 [Chorus:]
 Our song is the slamming screen door,
 Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
 When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
 'cause it's late and your mama don't know
 Our song is the way you laugh
 The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have"
 And when I got home ... 'fore I said amen
 Asking God if he could play it again
 
 I was walking up
 The front porch steps
 After everything that day
 Had gone all wrong
 And been trampled on
 And lost and thrown away
 Got to the hallway,
 Well on my way
 To my lovin' bed
 I almost didn't notice
 All the roses
 And the note that said...
 
 [Chorus:]
 Our song is the slamming screen door,
 Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
 When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
 'cause it's late and your mama don't know
 Our song is the way you laugh
 The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have"
 And when I got home ... 'fore I said amen
 Asking God if he could play it again
 
 I've heard every album, listened to the radio
 Waited for something to come along
 That was as good as our song...
 
 [Chorus:]
 'Cause our song is the slamming screen door,
 Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
 When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
 'cause it's late and his mama don't know
 Our song is the way he laughs
 The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, when I should have"
 And when I got home ... 'fore I said amen
 Asking God if he could play it again
 Play it again
 
 Oh, yeah...
 Oh-oh, yeah.
 
 I was riding shotgun
 With my hair undone
 In the front seat of his car
 I grabbed a pen
 And an old napkin
 And I wrote down our songFriday night beneath the stars,
 in a field behind your yard,
 you and I are paintin' pictures in the sky.
 And sometimes we don't say a thing;
 just listen to the crickets sing.
 Everything I need is right here by my side.
 And I know everything about you
 I don't wanna live without you.
 
 [Chorus:]
 I'm only up when you're not down.
 Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.
 It's like no matter what I do.
 Well you drive me crazy half the time;
 the other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true.
 And I'm only me when I'm with you.
 
 Just a small town boy and girl
 livin' in a crazy world.
 Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true.
 And I don't try to hide my tears.
 The secrets or my deepest fears.
 Through it all nobody gets me like you do.
 And you know everything about me.
 You say that you can't live without me.
 
 [Chorus]
 
 When I'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself.
 Only you can tell.
 
 [Chorus:]
 That I'm only up when you're not down.
 Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.
 It's like no matter what I do.
 Well you drive me crazy half the time;
 the other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true.
 And I'm only me
 Who I wanna be
 Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
 With you
 Uh huh
 YeahShe cant see the way your eyes
 Light up when you smile.
 Shell never notice how you stop and stare
 Whenever she walks by.
 
 And you cant see me wantin' you the way you want her
 But you are everything to me.
 
 [Chorus:]
 I just wanna show you
 She dont even know you,
 She's never gonna love you like I want to.
 And you just see right through me.
 If you only knew me
 We could be a beautiful
 Miracle,
 Unbelievable
 Instead of just invisible.
 
 Theres a fire inside of you
 That cant help but shine through.
 Shes never gonna see the light
 No matter what you do.
 
 And all I think about is how to make you think of me
 And everything that we could be
 
 [Chorus]
 
 Like shadows in a faded light
 Oh, were invisible.
 I just wanna open your eyes
 And make you realize.
 
 I just wanna show you
 She dont even know you.
 Baby, let me love you,
 Let me want you.
 You just see right through me
 But if you only knew me
 We could be a beautiful
 Miracle,
 Unbelievable
 Instead of just invisible.
 
 She cant see the way your eyes
 Light up when you smile.[Chorus 1:]
 Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
 Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?
 Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
 Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
 
 Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall.
 And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall.
 No matter what you say, I still can't believe
 That you would walk away.
 It don't make sense to me, but:
 
 [Repeat Chorus 1:]
 Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
 Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
 Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
 Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
 
 It's not unbroken anymore.
 How do I get it back the way it was before?
 
 [Chorus 2:]
 Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
 Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?
 Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
 Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a:
 
 [Repeat Chorus 1:]
 Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
 Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
 Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
 Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?Last Christmas I gave you my heart
 But the very next day, you gave it away
 This year, to save me from tears
 I'll give it to someone special
 
 Once bitten and twice shied
 I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
 Tell me baby
 Do you recognize me
 Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
 Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
 With a note saying 'I love you', I meant it
 Now I know what a fool I've been
 But if you kiss me now, I know you'd fool me again
 
 Last Christmas I gave you my heart
 But the very next day, you gave it away
 This year, to save me from tears
 I'll give it to someone special
 
 Last Christmas I gave you my heart
 But the very next day, you gave it away
 This year, to save me from tears
 I'll give it to someone special
 
 A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
 I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
 My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
 Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
 A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
 A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
 Maybe this year
 Maybe this year I'll give it to someone special
 
 Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart
 But the very next day, you gave it away
 This year, to save me from tears
 I'll give it to someone special
 
 Last Christmas I gave you my heart
 But the very next day, you gave it away
 This year, to save me from tears
 I'll give it to someone special
 
 And last Christmas
 And this year
 It won't be anything like, anything like
 
 Last Christmas I gave you my heart
 But the very next day, you gave it away
 This year, to save me from tears
 I'll give it to someone specialPlease take down the misletoe
 Cause I don't wanna think about that right now
 Cause everything I want is miles away
 In a snow covered little town
 My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me
 Season's greetings, hope you're well
 Well I'm doing alright
 If you were wondering
 Lately I can never tell
 
 I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
 But there were Christmases when you were mine
 
 I've been doing fine without you, really
 Up until the nights got cold
 And everybody's here, except you, baby
 Seems like everyone's got someone to hold
 
 But for me it's just a lonely time
 Cause there were Christmases when you were mine
 
 Merry Christmas everybody
 That'll have to be something I just say this year
 I'll bet you got your mom another sweater
 And were your cousins late again
 When you were putting up the lights this year
 Did you notice one less pair of hands
 
 I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
 But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight
 Cause there were Christmases when you were mine
 
 You were mineSanta baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
 I've been an awful good girl, santa baby
 So hurry down the chimney tonight
 
 Santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue
 Well I'll wait up for you, dear, santa baby
 So hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah
 
 Think of all the fun I've missed
 Think of all the boys I haven't kissed
 Next year I could be just as good
 If you check off my Christmas list
 
 Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
 I've been an angel all year, santa baby
 So hurry down the chimney tonight
 
 Santa, honey, there's one more thing I really do need, the deed
 To a platinum mine, santa honey
 So hurry down the chimney tonight
 
 Come and trim my Christmas tree
 With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
 I really do believe in you
 Let's see if you believe in me
 
 Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
 A ring
 And I don't mean on the phone, santa baby
 So hurry down the chimney tonightSilent night, holy night
 All is calm and all is bright
 Round yon virgin mother and child
 Holy infant so tender and mild
 Sleep in heavenly peace
 Sleep in heavenly peace
 
 Silent night, holy night
 Shepherds quake at the sight
 Glories stream from Heaven afar
 Heavenly hosts sing halleluia
 Christ the savior is born
 Christ our savior is born
 
 Silent night, holy night
 Son of God
 Love's pure light
 Radiant beams from thy holy face
 With the dawn of redeeming grace
 Jesus Lord at thy birth
 Jesus Lord at thy birth
 
 Halleluia!
 Halleluia!
 Halleluia!
 
 Christ the savior is bornWhat if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing?
 Would the song still survive without five golden rings?
 Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe?
 What would happen if God never let it snow?
 What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie?
 Tell me what would you find
 
 You'd see that today holds something special
 Something holy, not superficial
 So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
 It's something we all try to ignore
 And put a wreath up on your door
 So here's something you should know that is for sure
 Christmas must be something more
 
 What if angels did not pay attention to
 All the things that we wished they would always do?
 What if happiness came in a cardboard box?
 Then I think there is something we all forgot
 What would happen if presents all went away?
 Tell me what would you find
 
 You'd see that today holds something special
 Something holy, not superficial
 So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
 It's something we all try to ignore
 And put a wreath up on your door
 So here's something you should know that is for sure
 Christmas must be something more
 
 We get so caught up in all of it
 Business and relationships
 Hundred mile an hour lives
 And it's this time of year
 And everybody's here
 It seems the last thing on your mind
 
 Is that the day holds something special
 Something holy, not superficial?
 So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives
 It's something we all try to ignore
 And put a wreath up on your door
 But here's something you should know that is for sure
 Christmas must be something
 Christmas must be something
 Christmas must be something more
 
 There's gotta be more
 There's gotta be moreI'm dreaming of a white Christmas
 Just like the ones I used to know
 Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
 To hear sleigh bells in the snow
 
 I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
 With every Christmas card I write
 May your days be merry and bright
 And may all your Christmases be white
 
 I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
 Just like the ones I used to know
 So may your days be merry and bright
 And may all your Christmases be white
 
 May your days be merry and bright
 And may all your Christmases be whiteI like the way you sound in the morning
 We're on the phone and without a warning
 I realize your laugh is the best sound
 I have ever heard
 
 I like the way I can't keep my focus
 I watch you talk, you didn't notice
 I hear the words but all I can think is
 We should be together
 Every time you smile, I smile
 And every time you shine, I'll shine for you
 
 Whoa, oh, I'm feeling you baby
 Don't be afraid to
 Jump then fall
 Jump then fall into me
 Be there, never gonna leave you
 Say that you wanna be with me too
 So I'mma stay through it all
 So jump then fall
 
 Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
 You got the keys to me
 I love each freckle on your face, oh
 I've never been so wrapped up, honey
 I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
 
 I had time to think it all over
 And all I can say is come closer
 Take a deep breath then jump then fall into me
 Cause Every time you smile, I smile
 And every time you shine, I'll shine for you
 
 Whoa, oh, I'm feeling you baby
 Don't be afraid to
 Jump then fall
 Jump then fall into me
 Be there, never gonna leave you
 Say that you wanna be with me too
 So I'mma stay through it all
 So jump then fall
 
 The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
 I'll catch you, I'll catch you
 And people say things that bring you to your knees
 I'll catch you
 The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
 But I'll hold you through the night until you smile
 
 Whoa, oh, I need you baby
 Don't be afraid, please,
 Jump then fall
 Jump then fall into me
 Be there, never gonna leave you
 Say that you wanna be with me too
 So I'mma stay through it all
 So jump then fall
 Jump then fall, baby,
 Jump then fall into me, into me
 
 Every time you smile, I smile
 And every time you shine, I shine
 And every time you're here
 Baby I'll show you, I'll show you
 You can Jump then fall, jump then fall
 Jump then fall into me, into me, yeahUntouchable like a distant diamond sky, Mmmm
 I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
 I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you
 Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
 And when you're close I feel like coming undone
 
 In the middle of the night
 When I'm in this dream
 It's like a million little stars
 Spelling out your name
 You gotta come on, come on
 Say that we'll be together
 Come on, come on
 Little taste of Heaven
 
 It's half full and I won't wait here all day
 I know you're saying that you'll be here anyway
 But you're untouchable
 Burning brighter than the sun
 Now that you're close I feel like coming undone
 
 In the middle of the night
 When I'm in this dream
 It's like a million little stars
 Spelling out your name
 You gotta come on, come on
 Say that we'll be together
 Come on, come on
 
 Oh, In the middle of the night
 Waking from this dream
 I wanna feel you by my side
 Standing next to me
 You gotta come on, come on
 Say that we'll be together
 Come on, come on
 Little taste of Heaven
 
 Oh, oh I'm caught up in you
 Oh, oh, oh
 Untouchable burning brighter than the sun
 And when you're close I feel like coming undone
 
 In the middle of the night
 When I'm in this dream
 It's like a million little stars
 Spelling out your name
 You gotta come on, come on
 Say that we'll be together
 Come on, come on, oh oh
 
 Oh, Oh, In the middle of the night
 Waking from this dream
 I wanna feel you by my side
 Standing next to me
 You gotta come on, come on
 Say that we'll be together
 Come on, come on
 Little taste of Heaven
 
 Like a million little stars, spelling out your name
 Spelling out your nameOnce upon a time
 I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
 And we caught onto something
 I hold onto the night
 You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
 Were you just kidding cause it seems to me
 This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
 I don't feel welcome anymore
 Baby, what happened, please tell me
 Cause one second it was perfect
 Now you're half way out the door
 
 And I stare at the phone
 He still hasn't called
 And then you feel so low
 You can't feel nothing at all
 And you flashback to
 When he said forever and always
 Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
 Everything is wrong
 It rains when you're here
 And it rains when you're gone
 I was there when you said forever and always
 
 Was I out of line?
 Did I say something way too honest?
 Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
 I looked into your eyes
 Thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure
 So here's to everything coming down to nothing
 Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
 Where is this going?
 Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore
 
 And I stare at the phone
 He still hasn't called
 And then you feel so low
 You can't feel nothing at all
 And you flashback to
 When he said forever and always
 And it rains in your bedroom
 Everything is wrong
 It rains when you're here
 And it rains when you're gone
 I was there when you said forever and always
 
 You didn't mean it baby
 I don't think so, oh oh oh
 Back up, baby back up
 Did you forget everything?
 Back up, baby back up
 Did you forget everything?
 
 Back up, baby back up
 Please back up, oh back up
 Back up, baby back up
 
 Cause it rains in your bedroom
 Everything is wrong
 It rains when you're here
 And it rains when you're gone
 I was there when you said forever and always
 
 And I stare at the phone
 He still hasn't called
 And then you feel so low
 You can't feel nothing at all
 And you flashback to
 When we said forever and always
 Cause it rains in your bedroom
 Everything is wrong
 It rains when you're here
 And it rains when you're gone
 I was there when you said forever and always
 
 You didn't mean it baby
 You said forever and always, yeahI could go back to every laugh,
 But I don't wanna' go there anymore,
 And I know all the steps up to your door,
 But I don't wanna' go there anymore.
 
 Talk to the wind, talk to the sky,
 Talk to the man with the reasons why,
 And let me know what you find.
 
 Ill leave my window open,
 Cause Im too tired at night to call your name.
 Just know Im right here hopin,
 That youll come in with the rain.
 
 I could stand up and sing you a song,
 But I dont wanna have to go that far.
 And I, Ive got you down,
 I know you by heart,
 And you dont even know where I start.
 
 Talk to yourself, talk to the tears,
 Talk to the man who put you here,
 And dont wait for the sky to clear.
 
 Ill leave my window open,
 Cus Im too tired at night to call your name.
 Oh, just know Im right here hopin,
 That youll come in with the rain.
 
 Ive watched you so long,
 Screamed your name,
 I dont know what else I can say.
 
 But Ill leave my window open,
 Cus Im too tired at night for all these games.
 Just know Im right here hopin,
 That youll come in with the rain.
 
 I could go back to every laugh,
 But I dont wanna go there anymoreThis is wrong but I can't help but feel like
 There ain't nothing more right babe
 Misty morning comes again and I can't
 Help but wish I could see your face
 And I knew from the first note played
 I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
 You smile that beautiful smile and
 All the girls in the front row scream your name
 
 So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
 I can't take my eyes off of you
 I'm no one special, just another
 Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
 Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
 
 Good morning loneliness, comes around when I'm not
 Dreaming about you
 When my world wakes up today
 You'll be in another town
 And I knew when I saw your face, I'd be
 Counting down the ways to see you
 You smile that beautiful smile and
 All the girls in the front row scream your name
 
 So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
 I can't take my eyes off of you
 I'm no one special, just another
 Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
 Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
 
 You played in bars, you play guitar
 I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
 And you'll never see, sing me to sleep
 Every night from the radio
 
 So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
 I can't take my eyes off of you
 I'm no one special, just another
 Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
 Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
 Sweet, sweet superstar, superstarIn the heat of the fight I walked away
 Ignoring words that you were saying
 Trying to make me stay
 I said, "This time I've had enough."
 And you've called a hundred times
 But I'm not picking up
 
 'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
 But if you look a little closer
 
 I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
 To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
 Screaming, "I'm in love with you."
 Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
 And don't you leave 'cause I know
 All I need is on the other side of the door
 
 Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
 Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
 I keep going back over things we both said
 And I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread
 
 So babe if you know everything, tell me why you couldn't see
 When I left I wanted you to chase after me
 
 Yeah, I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
 To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
 Screaming, "I'm in love with you."
 Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
 And don't you leave 'cause I know
 All I need is on the other side of the door
 
 And I'll scream out the window
 I can't even look at you
 I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
 I say, "There's nothing you can say to make this right again.
 I mean it, I mean it."
 What I mean is...
 
 I said, "Leave," but baby all I want is you
 To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
 Screaming, "I'm in love with you."
 Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
 And don't you leave 'cause I know
 All I need is on the other side of the door
 
 With your face and the beautiful eyes
 And the conversation with the little white lies
 And the faded picture of a beautiful night
 You carry me from your car up the stairs
 And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
 After everything and that little black dress
 After everything I must confess, I need youThere's somethin' 'bout the way
 The street looks when it's just rained
 There's a glow off the pavement
 You walk me to the car
 And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
 In the middle of the parking lot
 Yeah
 Oh yeah
 
 We're drivin' down the road
 I wonder if you know
 I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
 But you're just so cool
 Run your hands through your hair
 Absent-mindedly makin' me want you
 
 And I don't know how it gets better than this
 You take my hand and drag me head first
 Fearless
 And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
 Fearless
 
 So, baby, drive slow
 'Til we run out of road in this one horse town
 I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
 You put your eyes on me
 In this moment now capture it, remember it
 
 'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
 You take my hand and drag me head first
 Fearless
 And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
 Fearless
 
 Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
 My hands shake
 I'm not usually this way
 But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave
 It's the first kiss,
 It's flawless,
 Really something,
 It's fearless.
 
 Oh yeah
 
 'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
 You take my hand and drag me head first
 Fearless
 And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
 Fearless
 
 'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
 You take my hand and drag me head first
 Fearless
 And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
 Fearless
 
 Oh-oh
 Oh yeahYou take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
 It's the morning of your very first day
 You say "Hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
 Try and stay out of everybody's way
 It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
 For the next four years in this town
 Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say,
 "You know I haven't seen you around before."
 
 'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
 You're gonna believe them
 And when you're fifteen
 Feeling like there's nothing to figure out
 Well count to ten, take it in
 This is life before you know who you're gonna be
 Fifteen
 
 You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
 And soon enough you're best friends
 Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
 We'll be out of here as soon as we can
 And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
 And you're feeling like flying
 And you're momma's waiting up and you think he's the one
 And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
 When the night ends
 
 'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
 You're gonna believe them
 When you're fifteen and your first kiss
 Makes your head spin round but
 In your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy of the football team
 But I didn't know it at fifteen
 
 When all you wanted was to be wanted
 Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
 Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
 But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
 
 And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
 Who changed his mind and we both cried
 
 'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
 You're gonna believe them
 And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
 I've found that time can heal most anything
 And you just might find who you're supposed to be
 I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen
 
 La la la la la la la
 La la la la la la la
 La la la la la la la
 
 Your very first day
 Take a deep breath, girl
 Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors.We were both young when I first saw you.
 I close my eyes and the flashback starts:
 I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air.
 
 See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.
 See you make your way through the crowd
 And say, "Hello, "
 Little did I know...
 
 That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles,
 And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
 And I was crying on the staircase
 Begging you, "Please don't go"
 And I said...
 
 Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
 I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.
 You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,
 It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".
 
 So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
 We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
 So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.
 Oh, oh.
 
 'Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,
 And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
 But you were everything to me,
 I was begging you, "Please don't go"
 And I said...
 
 Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
 I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.
 You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
 It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".
 
 Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.
 This love is difficult but it's real.
 Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
 It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".
 
 Oh, oh, oh.
 
 I got tired of waiting
 Wondering if you were ever coming around.
 My faith in you was fading
 When I met you on the outskirts of town.
 And I said...
 
 Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone.
 I keep waiting for you but you never come.
 Is this in my head? I don't know what to think.
 He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...
 
 Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.
 I love you, and that's all I really know.
 I talked to your dad - go pick out a white dress
 It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".
 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
 
 'Cause we were both young when I first saw youHey Stephen,
 I know looks can be deceiving
 But I know I saw a light in you.
 And as we walked
 We were talking 
 I didn't say half the things I wanted to.
 
 Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
 I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold.
 Hey Stephen,
 Boy, you might have me believing
 I don't always have to be alone.
 
 [Chorus:]
 'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel,
 Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
 So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.
 Can't help it if there's no one else.
 Mmm, I can't help myself.
 
 Hey Stephen,
 I've been holding back this feeling.
 So I've got some things to say to you, ha.
 I seen it all 
 So I thought 
 But I never seen nobody shine the way you do.
 
 The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name 
 It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change.
 Hey Stephen,
 Why are people always leaving?
 I think you and I should stay the same.
 
 [Chorus]
 
 They're dimming the street lights.
 You're perfect for me, why aren't you here tonight?
 I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out and pull me near to shine, shine, shine.
 
 Hey Stephen,
 I could give you fifty reasons
 Why I should be the one you choose.
 All those other girls 
 Well, they're beautiful
 But would they write a song for you?
 
 [Chorus:]
 I can't help it if you look like an angel,
 Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
 So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.
 Can't help it if there's no one else.
 Mmm, I can't help myself...
 ...if you look like an angel.
 Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
 So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.
 Can't help it if there's no one else.
 Mmm, I can't help myself.
 
 Myself,
 Can't help myself,
 I can't help myself.Say you're sorry
 That face of an angel
 Comes out just when you need it to
 As I paced back and forth all this time
 'Cause I honestly believed in you
 Holding on
 The days drag on
 Stupid girl,
 I should have known, I should have known
 
 [Chorus:]
 That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale,
 I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
 Lead her up the stairwell
 This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
 I was a dreamer before you went and let me down,
 Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around
 
 Maybe I was naive,
 Got lost in your eyes
 And never really had a chance
 My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
 You had to fight to have the upper hand
 I had so many dreams
 About you and me
 Happy endings
 Now I know
 
 [Chorus:]
 That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale,
 I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
 Lead her up the stairwell
 This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
 I was a dreamer before you went and let me down,
 Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around
 
 And there you are on your knees,
 Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
 Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry
 
 'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale,
 I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
 This is a big world, that was a small town
 They're in my rear view mirror disappearing now
 And it's too late for you and your white horse
 Now it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me now
 
 Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
 Try and catch me now
 Oh, it's too late
 To catch me nowYou're on the phone with your girlfriend
 She's upset, she's going off about something that you said
 'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.
 
 I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.
 I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.
 And she'll never know your story like I do.
 
 But she wears short skirts
 I wear t-shirts
 She's cheer captain
 And I'm on the bleachers
 Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
 That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.
 
 If you could see
 That I'm the one
 Who understands you.
 Been here all along.
 So, why can't you see
 You belong with me,
 You belong with me.
 
 Walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans
 I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.
 Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself,
 "Hey, isn't this easy?"
 
 And you've got a smile
 That could light up this whole town.
 I haven't seen it in a while
 Since she brought you down.
 
 You say you're fine I know you better than that.
 Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?
 
 She wears high heels,
 I wear sneakers.
 She's cheer captain,
 And I'm on the bleachers.
 Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
 That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.
 
 If you could see
 That I'm the one
 Who understands you,
 Been here all along.
 So, why can't you see
 You belong with me.
 
 Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
 All this time how could you not know, baby?
 You belong with me,
 You belong with me.
 
 [Instrumental]
 
 Oh, I remember you driving to my house
 In the middle of the night.
 I'm the one who makes you laugh
 When you know you're 'bout to cry.
 I know your favorite songs,
 And you tell me about your dreams.
 Think I know where you belong,
 Think I know it's with me.
 
 Can't you see
 That I'm the one
 Who understands you?
 Been here all along.
 So, why can't you see
 You belong with me.
 
 Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
 All this time how could you not know, baby?
 You belong with me,
 You belong with me.
 
 You belong with me.
 
 Have you ever thought just maybe
 You belong with me?
 You belong with me.I see your face in my mind as I drive away,
 Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way.
 People are people, and sometimes we change our minds.
 But it's killing me to see you go after all this time.
 
 Mmm mmm mmm
 Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
 Mmm mmm mmm
 Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
 
 Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie,
 It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see.
 Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down,
 Now I don't know what to be without you around.
 
 And we know it's never simple, never easy.
 Never a clean break, no one here to save me.
 You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,
 
 And I can't breathe without you
 But I have to.
 Breathe without you
 But I have to.
 
 Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt.
 Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve.
 People are people, and sometimes it doesn't work out,
 Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out.
 
 And we know it's never simple, never easy.
 Never a clean break, no one here to save me.
 You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,
 
 And I can't breathe without you
 But I have to.
 Breathe without you
 But I have to.
 
 It's two A.M.
 Feelin' like I just lost a friend.
 Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me.
 It's two A.M.
 Feelin' like I just lost a friend.
 Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me.
 
 And we know it's never simple, never easy.
 Never a clean break, no one here to save me.
 
 Ohhh
 
 And I can't breathe without you
 But I have to.
 Breathe without you
 But I have to.
 Breathe without you
 But I have to.
 
 I'm sorry (oh)
 I'm sorry (mmm)
 I'm sorry (eh eh)
 I'm sorry (mmm)
 I'm sorry (eh eh)
 I'm sorry (mmm)
 I'm sorryI took a chance, I took a shot 
 And you might think i'm bulletproof, but i'm not 
 You took a swing, I took it hard 
 And down here from the ground I see who you are 
 
 I'm sick and tired of your attitude 
 I'm feeling like I don't know you 
 You tell me that you love me then you cut me down 
 And I need you like a heartbeat 
 But you know you got a mean streak 
 Makes me run for cover when you're around 
 And here's to you and your temper 
 Yes, I remember what you said last night 
 And I know that you see what you're doing to me 
 Tell me why.. 
 
 You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day 
 Well I get so confused and frustrated 
 Forget what i'm trying to say, oh 
 
 I'm sick and tired of your reasons 
 I got no one to believe in 
 You tell me that you want me, then push me around 
 And I need you like a heartbeat 
 But you know you got a mean streak 
 Makes me run for cover when you're around 
 Here's to you and your temper 
 Yes, I remember what you said last night 
 And I know that you see what you're doing to me 
 Tell me why.. 
 
 Why..do you have to make me feel small 
 So you can feel whole inside 
 Why..do you have to put down my dreams 
 So you're the only thing on my mind 
 
 I'm sick and tired of your attitude 
 I'm feeling like I don't know you 
 You tell me that you want me then cut me down 
 I'm sick and tired of your reasons 
 I've got no one to believe in 
 You ask me for my love then you push me around 
 Here's to you and your temper 
 Yes, I remember what you said last night 
 And I know that you see what you're doing to me 
 Tell me why 
 Why, tell me why 
 
 I take a step back, let you go 
 I told you i'm not bulletproof 
 Now you knowAll this time I was wasting,
 Hoping you would come around
 I've been giving out chances every time
 And all you do is let me down
 And it's taken me this long
 Baby but I figured you out
 And you're thinking we'll be fine again,
 But not this time around
 
 You don't have to call anymore
 I won't pick up the phone
 This is the last straw
 Don't wanna hurt anymore
 And you can tell me that you're sorry
 But I don't believe you baby
 Like I did before
 You're not sorry, no no oh
 
 Looking so innocent,
 I might believe you if I didn't know
 Could've loved you all my life
 If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
 And you got your share of secrets
 And I'm tired of being last to know
 And now you're asking me to listen
 Cause it's worked each time before
 
 But you don't have to call anymore
 I won't pick up the phone
 This is the last straw
 Don't wanna hurt anymore
 And you can tell me that you're sorry
 But I don't believe you baby
 Like I did before
 You're not sorry, no no, oh
 
 You're not sorry no no oh
 
 You had me crying for you honey
 And it never would've gone away, no
 You used to shine so bright
 But I watched all of it fade
 
 So you don't have to call anymore
 I won't pick up the phone
 This is the last straw
 There's nothing left to beg for
 And you can tell me that you're sorry
 But I don't believe you baby
 Like I did before
 You're not sorry, no no oh
 
 You're not sorry, no no ohHe is sensible and so incredible 
 And all my single friends are jealous 
 He says everything I need to hear and it's like 
 I couldn't ask for anything better 
 He opens up my door and I get into his car 
 And he says you look beautiful tonight 
 And I feel perfectly fine 
 
 But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
 And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name 
 You're so in love that you act insane 
 And that's the way I loved you 
 Breakin' down and coming undone 
 It's a roller coaster kinda rush 
 And I never knew I could feel that much 
 And that's the way I loved you 
 
 He respects my space 
 And never makes me wait 
 And he calls exactly when he says he will 
 He's close to my mother 
 Talks business with my father 
 He's charming and endearing 
 And I'm comfortable 
 
 But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
 And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name 
 You're so in love that you act insane 
 And that's the way I loved you 
 Breakin' down and coming undone 
 It's a roller coaster kinda rush 
 And I never knew I could feel that much 
 And that's the way I loved you 
 
 He can't see the smile I'm faking 
 And my heart's not breaking 
 Cause I'm not feeling anything at all 
 And you were wild and crazy 
 Just so frustrating intoxicating 
 Complicated, got away by some mistake and now 
 
 I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
 It's 2am and I'm cursing your name 
 I'm so in love that I acted insane 
 And that's the way I loved you 
 Breaking down and coming undone 
 It's a roller coaster kinda rush 
 And I never knew I could feel that much 
 And that's the way I loved you oh, oh 
 
 And that's the way I loved you oh, oh 
 Never knew I could feel that much 
 And that's the way I loved youOnce upon a time,
 I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
 And we caught onto something
 I hold onto the night,
 You looked me in the eye
 And told me you loved me
 
 Were you just kidding?
 'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down
 We almost never speak
 I don't feel welcome anymore
 Baby, what happened, please tell me?
 'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're half way out the door
 
 And I stare at the phone,
 He still hasn't called
 And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
 And you flashback to when he said forever and always
 Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
 Everything is wrong
 It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
 'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
 
 Was I out of line?
 Did I say something way too honest?
 Made you run and hide
 Like a scared little boy?
 I looked into your eyes
 Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
 
 So here's to everything
 Coming down to nothing
 Here's to silence
 That cuts me to the core
 Where is this going?
 Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore
 
 And I stare at the phone,
 He still hasn't called
 And then you feel so low, you can't feel nothing at all
 And you flashback to when he said forever and always
 Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
 Everything is wrong
 It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
 'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
 
 You didn't mean it, baby,
 I don't think so
 
 Back up, baby, back up
 Did you forget everything?
 Back up, baby, back up
 Did you forget everything?
 
 'Cause it rains in your bedroom
 Everything is wrong
 It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
 'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
 
 Oh, I stare at the phone,
 He still hasn't called
 And then you feel so low
 You can't feel nothing at all
 And you flashback to when we said forever and always
 
 And it rains in your bedroom
 Everything is wrong
 It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
 'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
 
 You didn't mean it, baby,
 You said forever and always... yeahI'm five years old
 It's getting cold
 I've got my big coat on
 
 I hear your laugh
 And look up smiling at you
 I run and run
 
 Past the pumpkin patch
 And the tractor rides
 Look now -- the sky is gold
 I hug your legs and fall asleep
 On the way home
 
 I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
 I know you're not scared of anything at all
 Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
 But I know I had the best day
 With you today
 
 I'm thirteen now
 And don't know how my friends
 Could be so mean
 
 I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
 
 And we drive and drive
 Until we've found a town
 Far enough away
 
 And we talk and window-shop
 Until I've forgotten all their names
 
 I don't know who I'm gonna talk to
 Now at school
 I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
 Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
 But I know I had the best day
 With you today
 
 I have an excellent father
 His strength is making me stronger
 God smiles on my little brother
 Inside and out
 He's better than I am
 
 I grew up in a pretty house
 And I had space to run
 And I had the best days with you
 
 There is a video
 I found from back when I was three
 You set up a paint set in the kitchen
 And you're talking to me
 
 It's the age of princesses and pirate ships
 And the seven dwarfs
 Daddy's smart
 And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
 
 Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
 I know you were on my side
 Even when I was wrong
 And I love you for giving me your eyes
 Staying back and watching me shine
 
 And I didn't know if you knew
 So I'm taking this chance to say
 That I had the best day
 With you todayAnd its a sad picture,
 The final blow hits you
 Somebody else gets what you wanted again
 And you know its all the same,
 Another time and place
 Repeating history and youre getting sick of it
 
 But I believe in whatever you do
 And Ill do anything to see it through
 
 Because these things will change
 Can you feel it now?
 These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
 This revolution, the time will come
 For us to finally win
 And well sing hallelujah, well sing hallelujah
 
 So weve been outnumbered
 Raided and now cornered
 Its hard to fight when the fight aint fair
 Were getting stronger now
 Find things they never found
 They might be bigger
 But were faster and never scared
 
 You can walk away, say we dont need this
 But theres something in your eyes says we can beat this
 
 'Cause these things will change
 Can you feel it now?
 These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
 This revolution, the time will come
 For us to finally win
 And well sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
 
 Tonight we'll stand, get off our knees
 Fight for what weve worked for all these years
 And the battle was long, its the fight of our lives
 But well stand up champions tonight
 
 It was the night things changed
 Can you see it now?
 These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
 This revolution, throw your hands up
 'Cause we never gave in
 And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
 HallelujahUh, oh, oh
 Uh, oh, oh
 
 You were in college working part time waiting tables
 Left a small town, never looked back
 I was a flight risk with a fear of fallin
 Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts
 
 I say, "Can you believe it?"
 As were lying on the couch
 The moment I can see it.
 Yes, yes, I can see it now.
 
 Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
 You put your arm around me for the first time.
 You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter.
 You are the best thing thats ever been mine.
 
 Flash forward and were taking on the world together,
 And theres a drawer of my things at your place.
 You learn my secrets and you figure out why Im guarded,
 You say well never make my parents mistakes.
 
 But we got bills to pay,
 We got nothing figured out,
 When it was hard to take,
 Yes, yes, this is what I thought about.
 
 Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
 You put your arm around me for the first time
 You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
 You are the best thing thats ever been mine.
 
 Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
 You saw me start to believe for the first time
 You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
 You are the best thing thats ever been mine.
 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
 
 And I remember that fight
 Two-thirty AM
 As everything was slipping right out of our hands
 I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
 Braced myself for the "Goodbye."
 Cause thats all Ive ever known
 Then you took me by surprise
 You said, "Ill never leave you alone."
 
 You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water.
 And every time I look at you, its like the first time.
 I fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter.
 She is the best thing thats ever been mine."
 
 Hold on, make it last
 Hold on, never turn back
 
 You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
 You are the best thing thats ever been mine.
 
 (Hold on) do you believe it?
 (Hold on) we're gonna make it now.
 (Hold on) and I can see it,
 (Yes, yes) I can see it now (see it now, see it now...)The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm
 And I'm a house of cards
 You're the kind of reckless
 That should send me runnin'
 But I kinda know that I won't get far
 And you stood there in front of me
 Just close enough to touch
 Close enough to hope you couldn't see
 What I was thinking of
 
 Drop everything now
 Meet me in the pouring rain
 Kiss me on the sidewalk
 Take away the pain
 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
 Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
 Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
 
 My mind forgets to remind me
 You're a bad idea
 You touch me once and it's really something,
 You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be.
 I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
 But with you I know it's no good
 And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would...
 
 Drop everything now
 Meet me in the pouring rain
 Kiss me on the sidewalk
 Take away the pain
 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
 Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
 Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
 
 I'll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild.
 Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right.
 And lead me up the staircase
 Won't you whisper soft and slow?
 I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show.
 
 Drop everything now,
 Meet me in the pouring rain,
 Kiss me on the sidewalk,
 Take away the pain
 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile.
 Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
 Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
 
 And the sparks fly...
 Oh, baby, smile...
 And the sparks fly...I'm so glad you made time to see me.
 How's life? Tell me how's your family?
 I haven't seen them in a while.
 You've been good, busier than ever,
 We small talk, work and the weather,
 Your guard is up and I know why.
 Because the last time you saw me
 Is still burned in the back of your mind.
 You gave me roses and I left them there to die.
 
 So this is me swallowing my pride,
 Standing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night,"
 And I go back to December all the time.
 It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.
 Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
 I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.
 I go back to December all the time.
 
 These days I haven't been sleeping,
 Staying up, playing back myself leavin'.
 When your birthday passed and I didn't call.
 And I think about summer, all the beautiful times,
 I watched you laughing from the passenger side.
 Realized I loved you in the fall.
 
 And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
 You gave me all your love and all I gave you was "Goodbye".
 
 So this is me swallowing my pride
 Standing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night."
 And I go back to December all the time.
 It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
 Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
 I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
 I go back to December all the time.
 
 I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile,
 So good to me, so right
 And how you held me in your arms that September night
 The first time you ever saw me cry.
 
 Maybe this is wishful thinking,
 Probably mindless dreaming,
 But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right.
 
 I'd go back in time and change it but I can't.
 So if the chain is on your door I understand.
 
 But this is me swallowing my pride
 Standing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night."
 And I go back to December...
 It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
 Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
 I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.
 I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
 
 I go back to December all the time.
 All the time.I am not the kind of girl
 Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
 But you are not the kind of boy
 Who should be marrying the wrong girl
 
 I sneak in and see your friends
 And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
 And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
 Somewhere back inside a room
 Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
 
 This is surely not what you thought it would be
 I lose myself in a daydream
 Where I stand and say
 
 [Chorus:]
 Dont say "Yes", run away now
 Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door
 Dont wait or say a single vow
 You need to hear me out
 And they said, "Speak now."
 
 Fond gestures are exchanged
 And the organ starts to play
 A song that sounds like a death march
 And I am hiding in the curtains
 It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be
 
 She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
 But I know you wish it was me,
 You wish it was me,
 Dont you?
 
 [Chorus:]
 Dont say "Yes", run away now,
 Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.
 Dont wait or say a single vow,
 You need to hear me out,
 And they said, "Speak now."
 Dont say "Yes", run away now,
 Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.
 Dont wait or say a single vow,
 Your time is running out,
 And they said, "Speak now."
 
 Oh, la, la
 Oh, oh
 Say a single vow
 
 I hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace."
 Theres the silence, theres my last chance.
 I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me.
 Horrified looks from everyone in the room
 But Im only looking at you.
 
 I am not the kind of girl
 Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
 But you are not the kind of boy
 Who should be marrying the wrong girl
 
 [Chorus:]
 So, dont say "Yes", run away now,
 Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.
 Dont wait or say a single vow,
 You need to hear me out,
 And they said, "Speak now."
 And you say, "Lets run away now,
 Ill meet you when Im out of my tux at the back door.
 Baby, I didnt say my vows,
 So glad you were around
 When they said, "Speak now."Long were the nights when
 My days once revolved around you
 Counting my footsteps
 Praying the floor wont fall through, again
 And my mother accused me of losing my mind
 But I swore I was fine
 
 You paint me a blue sky
 And go back and turn it to rain
 And I lived in your chess game
 But you changed the rules everyday
 Wonderin which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
 Well I stopped pickin up and this song is to let you know why
 
 Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
 Don't you think I was too young
 To be messed with?
 The girl in the dress
 Cried the whole way home, I should've known.
 
 Well maybe its me
 And my blind optimism to blame
 Or maybe its you and your sick need
 To give love then take it away
 
 And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
 And I'll look back in regret how I ignored when they said,
 "Run as fast as you can."
 
 Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
 Don't you think I was too young
 To be messed with?
 The girl in the dress
 Cried the whole way home
 
 Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong
 Dont you think nineteens too young
 To be played by your dark, twisted games?
 When I loved you so, I should've known.
 
 You are an expert at "Sorry"
 And keeping lines blurry
 Never impressed by me acing your tests
 All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
 Cause you've burned them out
 
 But I took your matches
 Before fire could catch me
 So dont look now
 Im shining like fireworks
 Over your sad empty town
 
 Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
 Don't you think I was too young
 To be messed with?
 The girl in the dress
 Cried the whole way home
 
 I see it all now that you're gone
 Don't you think I was too young
 To be messed with?
 The girl in the dress
 Wrote you a song, you shouldve known.
 
 You shouldve known
 Dont you think I was too young?
 You shouldve known.You, with your words like knives
 And swords and weapons that you use against me
 You have knocked me off my feet again
 Got me feeling like a nothing
 You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
 Calling me out when I'm wounded
 You, picking on the weaker man
 
 Well you can take me down with just one single blow
 But you don't know, what you don't know...
 
 Someday I'll be living in a big ole city
 And all you're ever gonna be is mean
 Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
 And all you're ever gonna be is mean
 Why you gotta be so mean?
 
 You, with your switching sides
 And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
 You have pointed out my flaws again
 As if I don't already see them
 I walk with my head down
 Trying to block you out 'cause I'll never impress you
 I just wanna feel okay again
 
 I bet you got pushed around
 Somebody made you cold
 But the cycle ends right now
 'Cause you can't lead me down that road
 And you don't know, what you don't know...
 
 Someday I'll be living in a big ole city
 And all you're ever gonna be is mean
 Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
 And all you're ever gonna be is mean
 Why you gotta be so mean?
 
 And I can see you years from now in a bar
 Talking over a football game
 With that same big loud opinion
 But nobody's listening
 Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
 Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
 But all you are is mean
 
 All you are is mean
 And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
 And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean
 
 But someday I'll be living in a big ole city
 And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
 Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
 And all you're ever gonna be is mean
 Why you gotta be so?...
 
 Someday I'll be living in a big ole city (Why you gotta be so?...)
 And all you're ever gonna be is mean (Why you gotta be so?...)
 Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me (Why you gotta be so?...)
 And all you're ever gonna be is mean
 Why you gotta be so mean?I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us,
 How we met and the sparks flew instantly,
 and people would say, "They're the lucky ones."
 I used to know my place was the spot next to you,
 Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat,
 'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on.
 
 Oh, a simple complication,
 Miscommunications lead to fall-out.
 So many things that I wish you knew,
 So many walls up I can't break through.
 
 [Chorus:]
 Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,
 And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
 I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,
 And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.
 
 Next chapter.
 
 How'd we end up this way?
 See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy,
 And you're doing your best to avoid me.
 I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us,
 How I was losing my mind when I saw you here,
 But you held your pride like you should've held me.
 
 Oh, I'm scared to see the ending,
 Why are we pretending this is nothing?
 I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how,
 I've never heard silence quite this loud.
 
 [Chorus:]
 Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,
 And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
 I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,
 And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.
 
 This is looking like a contest,
 Of who can act like they care less,
 But I liked it better when you were on my side.
 The battle's in your hands now,
 But I would lay my armor down
 If you said you'd rather love than fight.
 So many things that you wish I knew,
 But the story of us might be ending soon.
 
 [Chorus:]
 Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,
 And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
 I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,
 And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now.
 And we're not speaking,
 And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
 I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate 'cause we're going down,
 And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.
 
 The end.Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
 And it's so quiet in the world tonight
 Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
 So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
 To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret
 I'd give all I have, honey
 If you could stay like that
 
 Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
 Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
 Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
 Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
 I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart
 And no one will desert you
 Just try to never grow up, never grow up
 
 You're in the car on the way to the movies
 And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
 At 14 there's just so much you can't do
 And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
 But don't make her drop you off around the block
 Remember that she's getting older too
 And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school
 
 Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
 Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
 Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
 Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
 No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred
 And even though you want to, just try to never grow up
 
 Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
 Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
 Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
 And all your little brother's favorite songs
 I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
 
 So here I am in my new apartment
 In a big city, they just dropped me off
 It's so much colder than I thought it would be
 So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on
 
 Wish I'd never grown up
 I wish I'd never grown up
 
 Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
 I could still be little
 Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
 It could still be simple
 Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
 Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
 Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
 Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
 Won't let nobody hurt you
 Won't let no one break your heart
 And even though you want to, please try to never grow up
 Oh, don't you ever grow up
 Oh, never grow up, just never grow upThere I was again tonight
 Forcing laughter, faking smiles
 Same old tired lonely place
 
 Walls of insincerity,
 Shifting eyes and vacancy
 Vanished when I saw your face
 
 All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
 
 Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
 Across the room your silhouette
 Starts to make its way to me
 The playful conversation starts
 Counter all your quick remarks
 Like passing notes in secrecy
 
 And it was enchanting to meet you
 All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
 
 This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
 I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
 I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
 I was enchanted to meet you
 
 The lingering question kept me up
 2 AM, who do you love?
 I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
 And now I'm pacing back and forth
 Wishing you were at my door
 I'd open up and you would say, "Hey,
 It was enchanting to meet you,
 All I know is I was enchanted to meet you."
 
 This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
 I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
 I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
 This night is flawless, don't you let it go
 I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
 I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
 I was enchanted to meet you
 
 This is me praying that
 This was the very first page
 Not where the story line ends
 My thoughts will echo your name
 Until I see you again
 These are the words I held back
 As I was leaving too soon
 I was enchanted to meet you
 
 Please don't be in love with someone else
 Please don't have somebody waiting on you
 Please don't be in love with someone else
 Please don't have somebody waiting on you
 
 This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
 I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
 I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
 This night is flawless, don't you let it go
 I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
 I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
 I was enchanted to meet you
 
 Please don't be in love with someone else
 Please don't have somebody waiting on you"Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did"
 
 Ha!
 Time for a little revenge
 
 The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and...
 I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
 She came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause
 She took him faster than you could say "sabotage"
 
 I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
 I underestimated just who I was dealing with
 She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
 She underestimated just who she was stealing from
 
 She's not a saint
 And she's not what you think
 She's an actress, whoa
 She's better known
 For the things that she does
 On the mattress, whoa
 Soon she's gonna find
 Stealing other people's toys
 On the playground won't
 Make you many friends
 She should keep in mind
 She should keep in mind
 There is nothing I do better than revenge
 
 She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
 She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
 I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
 And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
 
 But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
 Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
 They wouldn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
 But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
 
 She's not a saint
 And she's not what you think
 She's an actress, whoa
 She's better known
 For the things that she does
 On the mattress, whoa
 Soon she's gonna find
 Stealing other people's toys
 On the playground won't
 Make you many friends
 She should keep in mind
 She should keep in mind
 There is nothing I do better than revenge
 
 I'm just another thing for you
 To roll your eyes at, honey
 You might have him but haven't you heard
 I'm just another thing for you
 To roll your eyes at, honey
 You might have him but I always get the last word
 Whoa
 
 She's not a saint
 And she's not what you think
 She's an actress, whoa
 She's better known
 For the things that she does
 On the mattress, whoa
 Soon she's gonna find
 Stealing other people's toys
 On the playground won't
 Make you many friends
 She should keep in mind
 She should keep in mind
 There is nothing I do better than revenge
 
 Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
 'Cause I don't think you do. Oh.
 Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
 I don't think you do
 I don't think you do
 Let's hear the applause
 Come on show me how much better you are (so much better, yeah)
 So you deserve some applause 'cause you're so much better
 She took him faster than you could say "sabotage"I guess you really did it this time
 Left yourself in your warpath
 Lost your balance on a tightrope
 Lost your mind tryin' to get it back
 
 Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
 Always a bigger bed to crawl into
 Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
 And everybody believed in you?
 
 It's alright, just wait and see
 Your string of lights is still bright to me
 Oh, who you are is not where you've been.
 You're still an innocent,
 You're still an innocent.
 
 Did some things you can't speak of
 But at night you live it all again
 You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
 If only you had seen what you know now then
 
 Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?
 When everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you
 Wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep
 Before the monsters caught up to you?
 
 It's alright, just wait and see
 Your string of lights is still bright to me
 Oh, who you are is not what you've been
 You're still an innocent
 It's okay, life is a tough crowd
 32, and still growin' up now
 Who you are is not what you did.
 You're still an innocent.
 
 Time turns flames to embers
 You'll have new Septembers
 Every one of us has messed up too
 Minds change like the weather
 I hope you remember
 Today is never too late to be brand new
 
 It's alright, just wait and see
 Your string of lights is still bright to me
 Oh, who you are is not what you've been
 You're still an innocent.
 It's okay, life is a tough crowd
 32, and still growin' up now
 Who you are is not what you did
 You're still an innocent.
 You're still an innocent.
 
 Lost your balance on a tightrope.
 It's never too late to get it back.You and I walk a fragile line
 I have known it all this time
 But I never thought I'd live to see it break
 It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
 And I can't trust anything now
 And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake
 
 Oh, I'm holding my breath
 Won't lose you again
 Something's made your eyes go cold
 
 Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
 I thought I had you figured out
 Something's gone terribly wrong
 You're all I wanted
 Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
 I thought I had you figured out
 Can't breathe whenever you're gone
 Can't turn back now, I'm haunted
 
 Stood there and watched you walk away
 From everything we had
 But I still mean every word I said to you
 He will try to take away my pain
 And he just might make me smile
 But the whole time I'm wishing he was you instead
 
 Oh, I'm holding my breath
 Won't see you again
 Something keeps me holding on to nothing
 
 Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
 I thought I had you figured out
 Something's gone terribly wrong
 You're all I wanted
 Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
 I thought I had you figured out
 Can't breathe whenever you're gone
 Can't turn back now, I'm haunted
 
 I know, I know, I just know
 You're not gone. You can't be gone. No.
 
 Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
 I thought I had you figured out
 Something's gone terribly wrong
 Won't finish what you started
 Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
 I thought I had you figured out
 Can't breathe whenever you're gone
 Can't go back, I'm haunted
 
 Oh
 
 You and I walk a fragile line
 I have known it all this time
 Never ever thought I'd see it break.
 Never thought I'd see it...I still remember the look on your face
 Lit through the darkness at 1:58
 The words that you whispered
 For just us to know
 You told me you loved me
 So why did you go away?
 Away
 
 I do recall now the smell of the rain
 Fresh on the pavement
 I ran off the plane
 That July 9th
 The beat of your heart
 It jumps through your shirt
 I can still feel your arms
 
 But now I'll go sit on the floor
 Wearing your clothes
 All that I know is
 I don't know how to be something you miss
 I never thought we'd have a last kiss
 Never imagined we'd end like this
 Your name, forever the name on my lips
 
 I do remember the swing of your step
 The life of the party, you're showing off again
 And I roll my eyes and then
 You pull me in
 I'm not much for dancing
 But for you I did
 
 Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
 I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
 How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
 There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions
 
 And I'll go sit on the floor
 Wearing your clothes
 All that I know is
 I don't know how to be something you miss
 Never thought we'd have a last kiss
 Never imagined we'd end like this
 Your name, forever the name on my lips
 
 So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
 And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
 And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
 Hope it's nice where you are
 
 And I hope the sun shines
 And it's a beautiful day
 And something reminds you
 You wish you had stayed
 You can plan for a change in weather and time
 But I never planned on you changing your mind
 
 So I'll go sit on the floor
 Wearing your clothes
 All that I know is
 I don't know how to be something you miss
 Never thought we'd have a last kiss
 Never imagined we'd end like this
 Your name, forever the name on my lips
 
 Just like our last kiss
 Forever the name on my lips
 Forever the name on my lips
 
 Just like our last...I said remember this moment in the back of my mind
 The time we stood with our shaking hands
 The crowds in stands went wild
 We were the Kings and the Queens
 And they read off our names
 The night you danced like you knew our lives
 Would never be the same
 You held your head like a hero
 On a history book page
 It was the end of a decade
 But the start of an age
 
 Long live the walls we crashed through
 How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
 I was screaming long live all the magic we made
 And bring on all the pretenders
 One day, we will be remembered
 
 I said remember this feeling
 I pass the pictures around
 Of all the years that we stood there
 On the side-lines wishing for right now
 We are the Kings and the Queens
 You traded your baseball cap for a crown
 When they gave us our trophies
 And we held them up for our town
 And the cynics were outraged
 Screaming, "This is absurd!"
 Cause for a moment a band of thieves
 In ripped up jeans got to rule the world
 
 Long live the walls we crashed through
 How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
 I was screaming long live all the magic we made
 And bring on all the pretenders
 I'm not afraid
 Long live all the mountains we moved
 I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
 I was screaming long live that look on your face
 And bring on all the pretenders
 One day, we will be remembered
 
 Hold on to spinning around
 Confetti falls to the ground
 May these memories break our fall
 
 Will you take a moment, promise me this
 That you'll stand by me forever
 But if God forbid fate should step in
 And force us into a goodbye
 If you have children some day
 When they point to the pictures
 Please tell them my name
 Tell them how the crowds went wild
 Tell them how I hope they shine
 
 Long live the walls we crashed through
 I had the time of my life, with you
 Long, long live the walls we crashed through
 How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
 And I was screaming long live all the magic we made
 And bring on all the pretenders
 I'm not afraid
 Singing, long live all the mountains we moved
 I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
 And long, long live the look on your face
 And bring on all the pretenders
 One day, we will be rememberedElevator buttons and morning air
 Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
 If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
 But right now my time is theirs
 
 Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
 They'll judge it like they know about me and you
 And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
 The jury's out, but my choice is you
 
 So don't you worry your pretty little mind
 People throw rocks at things that shine
 And life makes love look hard
 The stakes are high, the water's rough
 But this love is ours
 
 You never know what people have up their sleeves
 Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
 Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
 But I don't care 'cause right now you're mine
 
 And you'll say
 Don't you worry your pretty little mind
 People throw rocks at things that shine
 And life makes love look hard
 The stakes are high, the water's rough
 But this love is ours
 
 And it's not theirs to speculate
 If it's wrong and
 Your hands are tough
 But they are where mine belong and
 I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
 With this song for you
 
 'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
 And I love the riddles that you speak
 And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
 'Cause my heart is yours
 
 So don't you worry your pretty little mind
 People throw rocks at things that shine
 And life makes love look hard
 Don't you worry your pretty little mind
 People throw rocks at things that shine
 But they can't take what's ours
 They can't take what's ours
 
 The stakes are high, the water's rough
 But this love is oursLast night I heard my own heart beating
 Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
 Six months gone and I'm still reaching
 Even though I know you're not there
 I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
 Thinking 'bout everything we've been through
 Maybe I've been going back too much lately
 When time stood still and I had you
 
 Come back, come back, come back to me like
 You would, you would if this was a movie
 Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
 Come back, come back, come back to me like
 You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
 I know that we could work it out somehow
 But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
 
 I know people change and these things happen
 But I remember how it was back then
 Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
 'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them,
 Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
 Flashback to the night when you said to me,
 "Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you,
 Not before I knew how much I had to lose."
 
 Come back, come back, come back to me like
 You would, you would if this was a movie
 Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
 Come back, come back, come back to me like
 You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
 I know that we could work it out somehow
 But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
 
 If you're out there,
 If you're somewhere,
 If you're moving on,
 I've been waiting for you.
 Ever since you've been gone
 I just want it back the way it was before.
 And I just wanna see you back at my front door.
 And I'd say
 
 Come back, come back, come back to me like
 You would before you said, "It's not that easy."
 Before the fight, before I locked you out
 But I take it all back now
 
 Come back, come back, come back to me like
 You would, you would if this was a movie
 Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
 Come back, come back, come back to me like
 You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
 I know that we could work it out somehow
 But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
 
 You'd be here by now
 It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
 Baby, what about the ending
 Oh, I thought you'd be here by now, whoa
 Thought you'd be here by nowTall, dark and superman
 He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
 To save the world or go to work
 It's the same thing to me
 He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
 I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
 I hang on every word you say, yay
 And you smile and say, "How are you? "
 I say, "Just fine"
 I always forget to tell you, I love you, I love you... forever
 
 I watch superman fly away
 You've got a busy day today
 Go save the world, I'll be around
 I watch superman fly away
 Come back I'll be with you someday
 I'll be right here on the ground
 When you come back down
 
 Tall, dark and beautiful
 He's complicated, he's irrational
 But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah
 Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
 He's not all bad like his reputation
 And I can't hear one single word they say
 And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be OK
 I always forget to tell you I love you, I loved you from the very first day
 
 I watch superman fly away
 You've got a busy day today
 Go save the world I'll be around
 I watch superman fly away
 Come back I'll be with you someday
 I'll be right here on the ground
 When you come back down
 
 And I watch you fly around the world
 And I hope you don't save some other girl
 Don't forget, don't forget about me
 I'm far away but I never let you go
 I'm lovestruck and looking out the window
 Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be
 Right here wishing the flowers were from you
 Wishing the card was from you
 Wishing the call was from you
 
 'Cause I loved you from the very first day
 
 I watch superman fly away
 You've got a busy day today
 Go save the world, I'll be around...
 Forever and ever here
 I watch superman fly away
 I swear I'll be with you someday
 I'll be right here on the ground
 When you come back down
 
 La, la, la, la, la, la
 La, la, la, la, la, la
 
 When you come back downI'm walking fast through the traffic lights
 Busy streets and busy lives
 And all we know
 Is touch and go
 We are alone with our changing minds
 We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time
 
 And I never (never) saw you coming
 And I'll never (never) be the same
 
 You come around and the armor falls
 Pierce the room like a cannonball
 Now all we know is don't let go
 We are alone, just you and me
 Up in your room and our slates are clean
 Just twin fire signs
 Four blue eyes
 
 So you were never a saint
 And Ive loved in shades of wrong
 We learn to live with the pain
 Mosaic broken hearts
 But this love is brave and wild
 
 And I never (never) {[x8:] Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh-oh-ooh} saw you coming
 And I'll never (never) be the same
 
 This is a state of grace
 This is the worthwhile fight
 Love is a ruthless game
 Unless you play it good and right
 These are the hands of fate
 You're my Achilles heel
 This is the golden age of something good and right and real
 
 And I never (never) saw you coming
 And I'll never (never) be the same
 
 And I never (never) {[x8:] Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh-oh-ooh} saw you coming
 And I'll never (never) be the same
 
 This is a state of grace
 This is the worthwhile fight
 Love is a ruthless game
 Unless you play it good and right[Verse 1:]
 Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
 Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
 Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
 Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all
 
 [Chorus:]
 Losing him was blue like I'd never known
 Missing him was dark grey all alone
 Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
 But loving him was red
 Loving him was red
 
 [Verse 2:]
 Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
 Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
 Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
 Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
 
 [Chorus:]
 Losing him was blue like I'd never known
 Missing him was dark grey all alone
 Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
 But loving him was red
 Oh, red
 Burning red
 
 [Bridge:]
 Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
 Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
 But moving on from him is impossible
 When I still see it all in my head
 In burning red
 Burning, it was red
 
 [Chorus:]
 Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
 Missing him was dark grey all alone
 Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
 'Cause loving him was red
 Yeah, yeah, red
 We're burning red
 
 [Post-Chorus:]
 And that's why he's spinnin' 'round in my head
 Comes back to me, burning red
 Yeah, yeah
 
 His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end streetPut your lips close to mine
 As long as they don't touch
 Out of focus, eye to eye
 Till the gravity's too much
 And I'll do anything you say
 If you say it with your hands
 And I'd be smart to walk away,
 But you're quicksand
 
 This slope is treacherous
 This path is reckless
 This slope is treacherous
 And I, I, I like it
 
 I can't decide if it's a choice
 Getting swept away
 I hear the sound of my own voice
 Asking you to stay
 And all we are is skin and bone
 Trained to get along
 Forever going with the flow,
 But you're friction
 
 This slope is treacherous
 This path is reckless
 This slope is treacherous
 And I, I, I like it
 
 Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
 And I will get you, and get you alone
 Your name has echoed through my mind
 And I just think you should, think you should know
 That nothing safe is worth the drive and I would
 Follow you, follow you home...
 I'll follow you, follow you home...
 
 This hope is treacherous
 This daydream is dangerous
 This hope is treacherous
 I, I, I... I, I, I... I, I, I...
 
 Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
 And I will get you, and get you alone
 Your name has echoed through my mind
 And I just think you should, think you should know
 That nothing safe is worth the drive and I will
 Follow you, follow you home...
 I'll follow you, follow you home...
 I'll follow you, follow you home...
 I'll follow you, follow you home...
 
 This slope is treacherous
 I, I, I like it[Music video spoken part:]
 I think--I think when it's all over,
 It just comes back in flashes, you know?
 It's like a kaleidoscope of memories.
 It just all comes back. But he never does.
 I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen.
 It's not really anything he said or anything he did,
 It was the feeling that came along with it.
 And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again.
 But I don't know if I should.
 I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright.
 But I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you?
 Maybe he knew that when he saw me.
 I guess I just lost my balance.
 I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him.
 It was losing me.
 
 Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
 I was in your sights, you got me alone
 You found me, you found me, you found me
 I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
 And when I fell hard you took a step back
 Without me, without me, without me
 
 And he's long gone when he's next to me
 And I realize the blame is on me
 
 'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 So shame on me now
 Flew me to places I'd never been
 'Til you put me down, oh
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 So shame on me now
 Flew me to places I'd never been
 Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
 Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
 Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
 
 No apologies. He'll never see you cry,
 Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why.
 You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning.
 Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
 A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
 And now I see, now I see, now I see
 
 He was long gone when he met me
 And I realize the joke is on me, yeah!
 
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 So shame on me now
 Flew me to places I'd never been
 'Til you put me down, oh
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 So shame on me now
 Flew me to places I'd never been
 Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
 Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
 Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
 
 And the saddest fear comes creeping in
 That you never loved me or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah
 
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 So shame on me now
 Flew me to places I'd never been
 'Til you put me down, oh
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there, you were right there)
 So shame on me now
 Flew me to places I'd never been
 Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
 Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
 Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
 
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 Trouble, trouble, trouble
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 Trouble, trouble, trouble
 
 [Music video spoken part:]
 I don't know if you know who you are until you lose who you are.I walked through the door with you, the air was cold,
 But something 'bout it felt like home somehow.
 And I left my scarf there at your sister's house,
 And you've still got it in your drawer even now.
 
 Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze.
 We're singing in the car, getting lost Upstate.
 Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place,
 And I can picture it after all these days.
 
 And I know it's long gone,
 And that magic's not here no more,
 And I might be okay,
 But I'm not fine at all.
 
 'Cause there we are again on that little town street.
 You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me.
 Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well.
 
 Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red.
 You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
 And your mother's telling stories about you on a tee ball team
 You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me.
 
 And I know it's long gone
 And there was nothing else I could do
 And I forget about you long enough
 To forget why I needed to...
 
 'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night.
 We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
 Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah.
 
 Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much,
 But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up.
 Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well.
 
 Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise.
 So casually cruel in the name of being honest.
 I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
 'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well.
 
 Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
 I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
 After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
 Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
 
 But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
 'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
 You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah
 
 'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so
 Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
 It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
 
 Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
 Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
 It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too wellIt feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
 And make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh.
 It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
 To fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh.
 
 Yeah,
 We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
 It's miserable and magical.
 Oh, yeah
 Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
 It's time
 
 Uh oh!
 I don't know about you
 But I'm feeling 22
 Everything will be alright
 If you keep me next to you
 You don't know about me
 But I'll bet you want to
 Everything will be alright
 If we just keep dancing like we're
 22, ooh-ooh
 22, ooh-ooh
 
 It seems like one of those nights,
 This place is too crowded.
 Too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh (who's Taylor Swift anyway, ew?)
 It seems like one of those nights,
 We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming
 Instead of sleeping.
 
 Yeah,
 We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
 It's miserable and magical.
 Oh, yeah
 Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
 It's time
 
 Uh oh! (hey!)
 I don't know about you
 But I'm feeling 22
 Everything will be alright
 If you keep me next to you
 You don't know about me
 But I'll bet you want to
 Everything will be alright (alright)
 If we just keep dancing like we're
 22, ooh-ooh (oh, oh, oh)
 22, ooh-ooh
 I don't know about you
 22, ooh-ooh
 22, ooh-ooh
 
 It feels like one of those nights,
 We ditch the whole scene.
 It feels like one of those nights,
 We won't be sleeping.
 It feels like one of those nights,
 You look like bad news.
 I gotta have you,
 I gotta have you.
 
 Ooh-ooh
 Ooh-ooh, ye-e-e-e-eah, hey
 I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
 But I'm feeling 22
 Everything will be alright
 If you keep me next to you
 You don't know about me (you don't know about me)
 But I'll bet you want to
 Everything will be alright
 If we just keep dancing like we're
 22, ooh-ooh
 22, ooh-ooh
 22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah
 22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
 
 It feels like one of those nights,
 We ditch the whole scene
 It feels like one of those nights,
 We won't be sleeping
 It feels like one of those nights,
 You look like bad news,
 I gotta have you,
 I gotta have you.I bet this time of night you're still up.
 I bet you're tired from a long hard week.
 I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
 And I bet sometimes you wonder about me.
 
 And I just wanna tell you
 It takes everything in me not to call you.
 And I wish I could run to you.
 And I hope you know that every time I don't
 I almost do,
 I almost do.
 
 I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
 'Cause each time you reach out there's no reply.
 I bet it never ever occurred to you that I can't say "Hello" to you
 And risk another goodbye.
 
 And I just wanna tell you
 It takes everything in me not to call you.
 And I wish I could run to you.
 And I hope you know that every time I don't
 I almost do,
 I almost do.
 
 Oh, we made quite a mess, babe.
 It's probably better off this way.
 And I confess, babe,
 In my dreams you're touching my face
 And asking me if I wanna try again with you.
 And I almost do.
 
 And I just wanna tell you
 It takes everything in me not to call you.
 And I wish I could run to you.
 And I hope you know that every time I don't
 I almost do,
 I almost do.
 
 I bet this time of night you're still up.
 I bet you're tired from a long hard week.
 I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
 And I hope sometimes you wonder about me.I remember when we broke up the first time
 Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like
 We hadn't seen each other in a month
 When you said you needed space. (What?)
 Then you come around again and say
 "Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me."
 Remember how that lasted for a day?
 I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you."
 
 Ooh, we called it off again last night
 But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
 
 We are never ever ever getting back together,
 We are never ever ever getting back together,
 You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
 But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
 
 Like, ever...
 
 I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
 And me falling for it screaming that I'm right
 And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
 With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
 
 Ooh, you called me up again tonight
 But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
 
 We are never, ever, ever getting back together
 We are never, ever, ever getting back together
 You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
 But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
 
 Ooh, yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
 Oh oh oh
 
 I used to think that we were forever ever
 And I used to say, "Never say never..."
 Uggg... so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you,"
 And I'm like... "I just... I mean this is exhausting, you know, like,
 We are never getting back together. Like, ever"
 
 No!
 
 We are never ever ever getting back together
 We are never ever ever getting back together
 You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
 But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
 
 We, ooh, getting back together, ohhh,
 We, ooh, getting back together
 
 You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
 But we are never ever ever ever getting back togetherI'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night.
 I threw my phone across the room at you.
 I was expecting some dramatic turn-away,
 But you stayed.
 
 This morning I said we should talk about it.
 'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved.
 That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said, "Okay, let's talk."
 
 And I said,
 Stay, stay, stay.
 I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
 You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
 But I think that it's best if we both stay.
 
 Before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers,
 Who took all of their problems out on me.
 But you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughin'.
 And I love you because you have given me no choice but to...
 
 Stay, stay, stay.
 I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
 You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
 But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay.
 
 You took the time to memorize me:
 My fears, my hopes, and dreams.
 I just like hangin' out with you all the time.
 All those times that you didn't leave;
 It's been occurring to me I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life.
 
 Stay.
 And I'll be loving you for quite some time.
 No one else is gonna love me, when I get mad, mad, mad.
 So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.
 
 Stay, stay, stay.
 I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
 You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
 But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.
 
 Stay, stay, stay.
 I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
 You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
 But I think that it's best if we both stay.
 
 [Background:] That's so fun![Gary Lightbody:]
 I find myself at your door,
 Just like all those times before,
 I'm not sure how I got there,
 All roadsthey lead me here.
 
 I imagine you are home,
 In your room, all alone,
 And you open your eyes into mine,
 And everything feels better,
 
 [Both:]
 and right before your eyes,
 I'm breaking, no past
 No reasons why,
 Just you and me.
 
 This is the last time I'm asking you this,
 Put my name at the top of your list,
 This is the last time I'm asking you why,
 You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye.
 
 [Taylor Swift:]
 You find yourself at my door,
 Just like all those times before,
 You wear your best apology,
 But I was there to watch you leave,
 
 And all the times I let you in,
 Just for you to go again,
 Disappear when you come back,
 Everything is better.
 
 [Both:]
 and right before your eyes,
 I'm aching, no past
 Nowhere to hide,
 Just you and me...
 
 This is the last time I'm asking you this,
 Put my name at the top of your list,
 This is the last time I'm asking you why,
 You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye...
 
 [Taylor Swift:] This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong,
 [Gary Lightbody:] This is the last time I say it's been you all along,
 [Taylor Swift:] This is the last time I let you in my door,
 [Gary Lightbody:] This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore.
 
 Oh, oh, oh,
 
 This is the last time I'm asking you this,
 Put my name at the top of your list,
 This is the last time I'm asking you why,
 You break my heart in the blink of an eye.
 
 [4x:]
 This is the last time I'm asking you,
 Last time I'm asking you,
 Last time I'm asking you this...I was reminiscing just the other day,
 While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away.
 Back to a first-glance feeling on New York Time.
 Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme.
 Took off faster than a green light "Go".
 Yeah, you skipped the conversation when you already know.
 I left a note on the door with a joke wed made,
 And that was the first day.
 
 And darling, it was good never looking down.
 And right there where we stood was holy ground.
 
 Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress,
 We had this big wide city all to ourselves.
 We blocked the noise with the sound of I need you,
 And for the first time I had something to lose,
 And I guess we fell apart in the usual way.
 And the storys got dust on every page,
 But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now.
 And I see your face in every crowd.
 
 Cause darling, it was good never looking down.
 And right there where we stood was holy ground.
 
 Tonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through.
 But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you.
 Tonight Im gonna dance like you were in this room.
 But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you,
 
 It was good never looking down.
 And right there where we stood was holy ground.
 
 Tonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through.
 But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you.
 Tonight Im gonna dance like you were in this room.
 But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you.Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
 Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
 I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
 Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait
 
 We had a beautiful magic love there
 What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
 
 In dreams I meet you in warm conversation
 We both wake in lonely beds in different cities
 And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
 And you've got your demons, and, darling, they all look like me
 
 'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
 What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
 
 Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
 Silence, this train runs off its tracks
 Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
 Hang up, give up, for the life of us we can't get back
 
 A beautiful magic love there
 What a sad beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful
 
 What we had  a beautiful magic love there
 What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
 
 We had a beautiful magic love there
 What a sad beautiful tragic love affairNew to town with a made up name in the angel's city,
 Chasing fortune and fame.
 And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream.
 
 You had it figured out since you were in school.
 Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool.
 So overnight you look like a sixties queen.
 
 Another name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky.
 
 And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
 Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
 But can you tell me now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh...
 
 Now its big black cars, and Riviera views,
 And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
 And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page.
 
 And they tell you that youre lucky.
 But youre so confused,
 'Cause you dont feel pretty, you just feel used.
 And all the young things line up to take your place.
 
 Another name goes up in lights. You wonder if youll make it out alive.
 
 And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
 Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
 Can you tell me now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.
 
 It was a few years later, I showed up here.
 And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared,
 How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out.
 They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere,
 Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square,
 And it took some time, but I understand it now.
 
 Cause now my name is up in lights, but I think you got it right,
 
 Let me tell you now, youre the lucky one.
 Let me tell you now, youre the lucky one.
 Let me tell you now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.
 
 Yeah theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
 Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
 And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.
 Oh, whoa, oh, oh[Taylor Swift]
 All I knew this morning when I woke
 Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before.
 And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
 Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
 In the back of my mind making me feel like
 
 [Taylor Swift]
 I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
 I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
 
 [Both]
 I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
 I just wanna know you, know you, know you
 
 [Both]
 'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello."
 And your eyes look like coming home
 All I know is a simple name
 Everything has changed
 All I know is you held the door
 You'll be mine and I'll be yours
 All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
 
 [Ed Sheeran]
 And all my walls stood tall painted blue
 And I'll take them down, take them down and open up the door for you
 
 [Taylor Swift (Album version) / Ed Sheeran (Remix version):]
 And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
 The beautiful kind, making up for lost time,
 [Album version:] Taking flight, making me feel right
 [Remix version:] Taking flight, making me feel right like
 
 [Both]
 I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
 I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
 I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
 I just wanna know you, know you, know you
 
 [Both]
 'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello."
 And your eyes look like coming home
 All I know is a simple name
 Everything has changed
 All I know is you held the door
 And you'll be mine and I'll be yours
 All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
 
 [Bridge]
 Come back and tell me why
 I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time, oh, oh, oh.
 And meet me there tonight
 And let me know that it's not all in my mind.
 
 [Taylor Swift]
 I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
 I just wanna know you, know you, know you
 
 [Both]
 All I know is we said, "Hello."
 And your eyes look like coming home
 All I know is a simple name
 Everything has changed
 All I know is you held the door
 You'll be mine and I'll be yours
 All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
 
 [Taylor Swift]
 All I know is we said, "Hello."
 So dust off your highest hopes
 All I know is pouring rain and everything has changed
 All I know is a new found grace
 All my days I'll know your face
 All I know since yesterday is everything has changedI said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
 It was the best night, never would forget how he moved.
 The whole place was dressed to the nines,
 And we were dancing, dancing
 Like we're made of starlight
 Like we're made of starlight
 
 I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
 Picked me up late one night out the window,
 We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
 Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
 The night we snuck into a yacht club party
 Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
 
 And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
 It was the best night, never would forget how he moved.
 The whole place was dressed to the nines,
 And we were dancing, dancing
 Like we're made of starlight, starlight
 Like we're made of starlight, starlight
 
 He said, "Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change.
 You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way."
 He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me,
 "Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
 Don't you dream impossible things?"
 
 Like "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
 It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
 The whole place was dressed to the nines,
 And we were dancing, dancing
 Like we're made of starlight, starlight
 Like we're made of starlight, starlight
 
 Ooh ooh he's talking crazy
 Ooh ooh dancing with me
 Ooh ooh we could get married
 Have ten kids and teach them how to dream
 
 Oh my, what a marvelous tune
 It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
 The whole place was dressed to the nines,
 And we were dancing, dancing
 Like we're made of starlight, starlight
 Like we're made of starlight, starlight
 Like we're made of starlight, starlight
 Like we dream impossible dreams
 Like starlight, starlight
 Like we dream impossible dreams
 Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
 Don't you dream impossible things?Took a deep breath in the mirror
 He didn't like it when I wore high heels
 But I do
 Turn the lock and put my headphones on
 He always said he didn't get this song
 But I do, I do
 
 Walked in expecting you'd be late
 But you got here early and you stand and wave
 I walk to you
 You pull my chair out and help me in
 And you don't know how nice that is
 But I do
 
 And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
 I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
 I've been spending the last eight months
 Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
 But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again
 
 You said you never met one girl
 Who had as many James Taylor records as you
 But I do
 We tell stories and you don't know why
 I'm coming off a little shy
 But I do
 
 But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
 I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
 
 I've been spending the last eight months
 Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
 But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again
 
 And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up
 But you start to talk about the movies that your family
 Watches
 Every single Christmas and I want to talk about that
 And for the first time what's past is past
 
 'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
 I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
 I've been spending the last eight months
 
 Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
 But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again
 
 But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin againYou should've been there,
 Should've burst through the door,
 With that 'baby I'm right here' smile,
 And it would've felt like,
 A million little shining stars had just aligned,
 And I would've been so happy.
 
 Christmas lights glisten,
 I've got my eye on the door,
 Just waiting for you to walk in,
 But the time is ticking,
 People ask me how I've been
 As I comb back through my memory,
 How you said you'd be here,
 You said you'd be here.
 
 And it was like slow motion,
 Standing there in my party dress,
 In red lipstick,
 With no one to impress,
 And they're all laughing,
 As I'm looking around the room,
 But there's one thing missing,
 And that was the moment I knew.
 
 And the hours pass by,
 Now I just wanna be alone,
 But your close friends always seem to know
 When there's something really wrong,
 So they follow me down the hall,
 And there in the bathroom,
 I try not to fall apart,
 And the sinking feeling starts,
 As I say hopelessly,
 "He said he'd be here."
 
 And it was like slow motion,
 Standing there in my party dress,
 In red lipstick,
 With no one to impress,
 And they're all laughing,
 And asking me about you,
 But there was one thing missing,
 And that was the moment I knew.
 
 What do you say
 When tears are streaming down your face
 In front of everyone you know?
 And what do you do when the one
 Who means the most to you
 Is the one who didn't show?
 
 You should've been here.
 And I would've been so happy.
 
 And it was like slow motion,
 Standing there in my party dress,
 In red lipstick,
 With no one to impress,
 And they're all standing around me singing
 "Happy birthday to you",
 But there was one thing missing,
 And that was the moment I knew.
 
 Ooh, I knew.
 Ooh,
 
 You called me later,
 And said, "I'm sorry, I didn't make it,"
 And I said, "I'm sorry too,"
 And that was the moment I knew.You said it in a simple way,
 4 AM, the second day,
 How strange that I don't know you at all.
 Stumbled through the long goodbye,
 One last kiss, then catch your flight,
 Right when I was just about to fall
 
 I told myself, "Don't get attached,"
 But in my mind I play it back,
 Spinning faster than the plane that took you...
 
 And this is when the feeling sinks in,
 I don't wanna miss you like this,
 Come back... be here, come back... be here.
 I guess you're in New York today,
 I don't wanna need you this way,
 Come back... be here, come back... be here.
 
 The delicate beginning rush,
 The feeling you can know so much,
 Without knowing anything at all.
 And now that I can't put this down,
 If I had known what I'd known now,
 I never would have played so nonchalant.
 
 Taxi cabs and busy streets,
 That never bring you back to me,
 I can't help but wish you took me with you...
 
 And this is when the feeling sinks in,
 I don't wanna miss you like this,
 Come back... be here, come back... be here.
 I guess you're in London today,
 I don't wanna need you this way,
 Come back... be here, come back... be here.
 
 This is falling in love in the cruelest way,
 This is falling for you when you are worlds away.
 
 New York... be here.
 But you're in London and I break down,
 'Cause it's not fair that you're not around.
 
 This is when the feeling sinks in,
 I don't wanna miss you like this,
 Come back... be here, come back... be here.
 I guess you're in New York today,
 And I don't wanna need you this way,
 Come back... be here, come back... be here.
 
 I don't wanna miss you like this.
 Come back... be here.
 Come back... be here.Don't look at me,
 You've got a girl at home,
 And everybody knows that,
 Everybody knows that,
 Uh, uh
 Don't look at me,
 You've got a girl at home,
 And everybody knows that.
 
 I don't even know her,
 But I feel a responsibility,
 To do what's upstanding and right,
 It's kinda like a code, yeah,
 And you've been getting closer and closer,
 And crossing so many lines.
 
 And it would be a fine proposition,
 If I was a stupid girl,
 But honey I am no-one's exception,
 This I have previously learned.
 
 So don't look at me,
 You've got a girl at home,
 And everybody knows that,
 Everybody knows that,
 Uh, uh
 Don't look at me,
 You've got a girl at home,
 And everybody knows that,
 Everybody knows that,
 I see you turn off your phone,
 And now you got me alone,
 And I say,
 Don't look at me,
 You've got a girl at home,
 And everybody knows that,
 Everybody knows that.
 
 I just wanna make sure,
 You understand perfectly,
 You're the kind of man who makes me sad,
 While she waits up,
 You chase down the newest thing,
 And take for granted what you have.
 
 And it would be a fine proposition,
 If I was a stupid girl,
 And yeah I might go with it,
 If I hadn't once been just like her.
 
 Don't look at me,
 You've got a girl at home,
 And everybody knows that,
 Everybody knows that,
 Uh, uh
 Don't look at me,
 You've got a girl at home,
 And everybody knows that,
 Everybody knows that,
 I see you turn off your phone,
 And now you've got me alone,
 And I say,
 Don't look at me,
 You've got a girl at home,
 And everybody knows that,
 Everybody knows that.
 
 Call a cab,
 Lose my number,
 You're about to lose your girl,
 Call a cab,
 Lose my number,
 Let's consider this lesson learned.
 
 Don't look at me,
 You've got a girl at home,
 And everybody knows that,
 Everybody knows that,
 Uh, uh
 Don't look at me,
 You've got a girl at home,
 And everybody knows that,
 Everybody knows that,
 Wanna see you pick up your phone,
 And tell her you're coming home,
 Don't look at me,
 You've got a girl at home,
 And everybody knows that,
 Everybody knows that,
 Uh, uh
 Don't look at me,
 You've got a girl at home,
 And everybody knows that,
 Everybody knows that.
 
 It would be a fine proposition,
 If I hadn't once been just like her.Walking through a crowd
 The village is aglow
 Kaleidoscope of loud
 Heartbeats under coats
 Everybody here
 Wanted something more
 Searching for a sound we hadn't
 Heard before
 And it said
 
 [Chorus:]
 Welcome to New York
 It's been waiting for you
 Welcome to New York
 Welcome to New York
 Welcome to New York
 It's been waiting for you
 Welcome to New York
 Welcome to New York
 
 It's a new soundtrack
 I could dance to this beat, beat
 Forever more
 The lights are so bright
 But they never blind me, me
 Welcome to New York
 It's been waiting for you
 Welcome to New York
 
 When we first dropped our bags on
 Apartment floors
 Took our broken hearts
 Put them in a drawer
 Everybody here was someone else
 Before
 And you can want who you want
 Boys and boys and
 Girls and girls
 
 [Chorus:]
 Welcome to New York
 It's been waiting for you
 Welcome to New York
 Welcome to New York
 Welcome to New York
 It's been waiting for you
 Welcome to New York
 Welcome to New York
 
 It's a new soundtrack
 I could dance to this beat, beat
 Forever more
 The lights are so bright
 But they never blind me, me
 Welcome to New York (New York)
 It's been waiting for you
 Welcome to New York
 Welcome to New York
 
 Like any great love it keeps you
 Guessing
 Like any real love
 It's ever changing
 Like any true love
 
 It drives you crazy
 But you know you wouldn't
 Change anything anything
 Anything
 
 [Chorus:]
 Welcome to New York
 It's been waiting for you
 Welcome to New York
 Welcome to New York
 Welcome to New York
 It's been waiting for you
 Welcome to New York
 Welcome to New York
 
 It's a new soundtrack
 I could dance to this beat
 The lights are so bright
 But they never blind me
 Welcome to New York
 New soundtrack
 It's been waiting for you
 Welcome to New York
 The lights are so bright
 But they never blind me
 Welcome to New York
 So bright
 They never blind me
 Welcome to New York
 Welcome to New YorkNice to meet you, where you been?
 I could show you incredible things
 Magic, madness, heaven, sin
 Saw you there and I thought
 Oh my God, look at that face
 You look like my next mistake
 Love's a game, wanna play?
 
 New money, suit and tie
 I can read you like a magazine
 Ain't it funny, rumors fly
 And I know you heard about me
 So hey, let's be friends
 I'm dying to see how this one ends
 Grab your passport and my hand
 I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
 
 So it's gonna be forever
 Or it's gonna go down in flames
 You can tell me when it's over
 If the high was worth the pain
 Got a long list of ex-lovers
 They'll tell you I'm insane
 'Cause you know I love the players
 And you love the game
 
 'Cause we're young and we're reckless
 We'll take this way too far
 It'll leave you breathless
 Or with a nasty scar
 Got a long list of ex-lovers
 They'll tell you I'm insane
 But I've got a blank space, baby
 And I'll write your name
 
 Cherry lips, crystal skies
 I could show you incredible things
 Stolen kisses, pretty lies
 You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
 Find out what you want
 Be that girl for a month
 Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no
 
 Screaming, crying, perfect storms
 I can make all the tables turn
 Rose garden filled with thorns
 Keep you second guessing like
 "Oh my God, who is she?"
 I get drunk on jealousy
 But you'll come back each time you leave
 'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
 
 So it's gonna be forever
 Or it's gonna go down in flames
 You can tell me when it's over
 If the high was worth the pain
 Got a long list of ex-lovers
 They'll tell you I'm insane
 'Cause you know I love the players
 And you love the game
 
 'Cause we're young and we're reckless
 We'll take this way too far
 It'll leave you breathless
 Or with a nasty scar
 Got a long list of ex-lovers
 They'll tell you I'm insane
 But I've got a blank space, baby
 And I'll write your name
 
 Boys only want love if it's torture
 Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya
 Boys only want love if it's torture
 Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya
 
 So it's gonna be forever
 Or it's gonna go down in flames
 You can tell me when it's over
 If the high was worth the pain
 Got a long list of ex-lovers
 They'll tell you I'm insane
 'Cause you know I love the players
 And you love the game
 
 'Cause we're young and we're reckless
 We'll take this way too far
 It'll leave you breathless
 Or with a nasty scar
 Got a long list of ex-lovers
 They'll tell you I'm insane
 But I've got a blank space, baby
 And I'll write your nameMidnight,
 You come and pick me up, no headlights
 A long drive,
 Could end in burning flames or paradise
 Fade into view, oh, it's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you)
 
 I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
 Know exactly where it leads but I
 Watch us go 'round and 'round each time
 
 You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
 And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
 And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
 'Cause we never go out of style
 We never go out of style
 
 You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
 And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
 And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
 'Cause we never go out of style
 We never go out of style.
 
 So it goes
 He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
 Takes me home
 Lights are off, he's taking off his coat, hmm, yeah.
 I say, "I heard, oh, that you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl."
 
 He says, "What you've heard is true but I
 Can't stop thinking about you," and I...
 I said, "I've been there, too, a few times."
 
 'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
 And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
 And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
 'Cause we never go out of style
 We never go out of style
 
 You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
 And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (tight little skirt)
 And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
 'Cause we never go out of style
 We never go out of style
 
 Take me home
 Just take me home, yeah.
 Just take me home
 (out of style)
 
 You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
 And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
 And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
 'Cause we never go out of style
 We never go out of styleLooking at it now
 It all seems so simple
 We were lying on your couch
 I remember
 You took a Polaroid of us
 Then discovered (then discovered)
 The rest of the world was black and white
 But we were in screaming color
 And I remember thinking
 
 [Chorus 2x:]
 Are we out of the woods yet?
 Are we out of the woods yet?
 Are we out of the woods yet?
 Are we out of the woods?
 Are we in the clear yet?
 Are we in the clear yet?
 Are we in the clear yet?
 In the clear yet?
 Good
 
 Are we out of the woods?
 
 Looking at it now
 Last December (last December)
 We were built to fall apart
 Then fall back together (back together)
 Your necklace hanging from my neck
 The night we couldn't quite forget
 When we decided (we decided)
 To move the furniture so we could dance,
 Baby, like we stood a chance
 Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
 And I remember thinkin'
 
 [Chorus 2x]
 
 (Are we out of the woods?!)
 
 Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
 Twenty stitches in the hospital room
 When you started cryin', baby, I did, too
 But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you
 Remember when we couldn't take the heat
 I walked out and said, "I'm settin' you free,"
 But the monsters turned out to be just trees
 And when the sun came up, you were lookin' at me
 You were lookin' at me
 You were lookin' at me,
 I remember, oh, I remember
 
 [Chorus 4x]People like you always want back the love they gave away
 And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed
 The more I think about it now the less I know
 All I know is that you drove us off the road
 
 Stay
 Hey, all you had to do was stay
 Had me in the palm of your hand
 Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
 Stay, hey, now you say you want it
 Back now that it's just too late
 Well, it could've been easy
 All you had to do was stay
 
 All you had to do was stay
 All you had to do was stay
 All you had to do was stay
 All you had to do was stay
 
 Here you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say
 I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made
 People like you always want back the love they pushed aside
 But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye
 
 Stay
 Hey, all you had to do was stay
 Had me in the palm of your hand
 Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
 Stay, hey, now you say you want it
 Back now that it's just too late
 Well, it could've been easy
 All you had to do was stay
 
 All you had to do was stay
 All you had to do was stay
 All you had to do was stay
 
 Let me remind
 You this was what you wanted
 You ended it
 You were all I wanted
 But not like this
 Not like this
 Not like this
 Oh, all you had to do was stay
 
 Hey, all you had to do was stay
 Had me in the palm of your hand
 Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in

 All you had to do was stayI stay out too late
 Got nothing in my brain
 That's what people say, mmm-mmm
 That's what people say, mmm-mmm
 
 I go on too many dates [chuckle]
 But I can't make them stay
 At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm
 That's what people say, mmm-mmm
 
 But I keep cruising
 Can't stop, won't stop moving
 It's like I got this music
 In my mind
 Saying, "It's gonna be alright."
 
 'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
 And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
 Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
 I shake it off, I shake it off
 Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
 And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
 Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
 I shake it off, I shake it off
 
 I never miss a beat
 I'm lightning on my feet
 And that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
 That's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
 
 I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own)
 I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
 And that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
 That's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
 
 But I keep cruising
 Can't stop, won't stop grooving

 You could've been getting down to this sick beat.
 
 My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
 She's like "Oh, my god!" but I'm just gonna shake.
 And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
 Won't you come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake

 I, I, I shake it off, I shake it offIt's 2 AM in your car
 Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
 You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
 You're thinking that I hate you now
 'Cause you still don't know what I never said
 
 I wish you would come back,
 Wish I never hung up the phone like I did.
 And I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
 And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
 I wish you would
 
 It's 2 AM in my room.
 Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you.
 We're a crooked love in a straight line down.
 Makes you wanna run and hide
 Then it makes you turn right back around
 
 I wish you would come back,
 Wish I never hung up the phone like I did.
 I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
 And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
 I wish you would
 
 I wish we could go back
 And remember what we were fighting for.
 And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore
 And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
 I wish you would
 
 I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
 I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
 I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish.
 
 You always knew how to push my buttons
 You give me everything and nothing
 This mad mad love makes you come running
 To stand back where you stood
 I wish you would, I wish you would
 I wish you would, I wish you would
 
 I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish...
 
 2 AM, here we are
 See your face, hear my voice in the dark
 We're a crooked love in a straight line down
 Makes you wanna run and hide
 But it made us turn right back around
 
 I wish you would come back
 Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
 I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
 And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.

 This mad mad love makes you come running
 To stand back where you stood

 I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish you would'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
 You know it used to be mad love
 So take a look what you've done
 'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
 Hey
 Now we got problems
 And I don't think we can solve them
 You made a really deep cut
 And, baby, now we got bad blood
 Hey
 
 Did you have to do this? I was thinking that you could be trusted
 Did you have to ruin what was shiny? Now it's all rusted
 Did you have to hit me, where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
 And rub it in so deep, salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
 
 Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I
 
 'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
 You know it used to be mad love
 So take a look what you've done
 'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
 Hey
 Now we got problems
 And I don't think we can solve them
 You made a really deep cut
 And, baby, now we got bad blood
 Hey
 
 Did you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my back from your knife
 So don't think it's in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
 Now did you think it all through? All these things will catch up to you
 And time can heal but this won't, so if you're coming my way, just don't
 
 Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I

 You say sorry just for show
 If you live like that, you live with ghosts (ghosts)
 Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey)

 HeyHe said, "Let's get out of this town,
 Drive out of the city, away from the crowds."
 I thought heaven can't help me now.
 Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down
 
 He's so tall and handsome as hell
 He's so bad but he does it so well
 I can see the end as it begins
 My one condition is
 
 Say you'll remember me
 Standing in a nice dress,
 Staring at the sunset, babe
 Red lips and rosy cheeks
 Say you'll see me again
 Even if it's just in your
 Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh,
 Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh.
 
 I said, "No one has to know what we do, "
 His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
 And his voice is a familiar sound,
 Nothing lasts forever but this is getting good now
 
 He's so tall and handsome as hell
 He's so bad but he does it so well
 And when we've had our very last kiss
 My last request it is
 
 Say you'll remember me
 Standing in a nice dress,
 Staring at the sunset, babe
 Red lips and rosy cheeks
 Say you'll see me again
 Even if it's just in your
 Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh,
 Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh.
 
 You see me in hindsight
 Tangled up with you all night
 Burning it down
 Someday when you leave me
 I bet these memories
 Follow you around
 
 You'll see me in hindsight
 Tangled up with you all night
 Burning it down
 Someday when you leave me

 In your wildest dreams, ah-ha.Oh oh oh.
 Oh-oh.
 
 Stand there like a ghost shaking from the rain (rain).
 She'll open up the door and say, "Are you insane ('ane)?"
 Say it's been a long 6 months
 And you were too afraid to tell her what you want.
 
 And that's how it works.
 That's how you get the girl.
 And then you say,
 
 "I want you for worse or for better,
 I would wait forever and ever,
 Broke your heart, I'll put it back together.
 I would wait forever and ever."
 
 And that's how it works
 It's how you get the girl, girl...
 Oh.
 
 And that's how it works
 It's how you get the girl, girl...
 
 Remind her how it used to be (yeah, yeah)
 With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks (cheeks)
 Tell her how you must have lost your mind. (uh-uh)
 When you left her all alone, and never told her why (why).
 
 And that's how it works.
 That's how you lost the girl.
 And now you say,
 
 "I want you for worse or for better,
 I would wait forever and ever (ever and ever),
 Broke your heart, I'll put it back together (together).
 I would wait forever and ever (ever and ever)."
 
 And that's how it works
 It's how you get the girl, girl...
 Oh.
 
 And that's how it works
 It's how you get the girl, girl... (Yeah, yeah)
 
 And you could know (oh-oh oh oh)
 That I don't want you to go oh-oh..
 
 Remind me how it used to be.
 Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks.
 And say you want me.
 Yeah...
 
 And then you say,
 
 "I want you for worse or for better (for worse or for better),
 I would wait forever and ever,
 Broke your heart, I'll put it back together.
 I want you forever and ever."
 
 [4x]
 And that's how it works
 It's how you get the girl, girl.
 Oh.
 
 That's how it works.
 That's how you got the girl.Clear blue water, high tide came and brought you in
 And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
 Skies grew darker, currents swept you out again
 And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone
 
 In silent screams,
 in wildest dreams
 I never dreamed of this
 
 This love is good, this love is bad
 This love is alive back from the dead
 These hands had to let it go free
 And this love came back to me
 
 Tossing, turning, struggled through the night with someone new
 And I could go on and on, on and on
 Lantern burning, flickered in my mind for only you
 But you're still gone, gone, gone
 
 Been losing grip,
 oh, sinking ships
 You showed up just in time
 
 This love is good, this love is bad
 This love is alive back from the dead
 These hands had to let it go free
 And this love came back to me
 
 This love left a permanent mark
 This love is glowing in the dark
 These hands had to let it go free
 And this love came back to me
 
 This love, this love, this love, this love... [4x]
 
 Your kiss, my cheek, I watched you leave
 Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees
 When you're young you just run
 But you come back to what you need
 
 This love is good, this love is bad
 This love is alive back from the dead
 These hands had to let it go free
 And this love came back to me
 
 This love left a permanent mark
 This love is glowing in the dark
 These hands had to let it go free
 And this love came back to me
 
 This love, this love, this love, this love... [4x]You stand with your hand on my waist line
 It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
 I can hear them whisper as we pass by
 It's a bad sign, bad sign
 Something happens when everybody finds out
 See the vultures circling dark clouds
 Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
 It could burn out 
 
 Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes
 And guns
 They are the hunters, we are the foxes
 And we run
 
 Baby, I know places we won't be found 
 And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
 Cause I, I know places we can hide
 I know places, I know places
 
 Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
 Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
 Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
 Not this time 
 
 Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
 My love
 They are the hunters, we are the foxes
 And we run
 
 Baby, I know places we won't be found 
 And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
 Cause I, I know places we can hide
 I know places 
 
 They are the hunters, we are the foxes
 And we run
 Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
 My love
 
 Baby, I know places we won't be found 
 And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
 Cause I, I know places we can hide
 I know places
 
 They take their shots, but we're bulletproof
 I know places
 And you know for me, it's always you
 I know places
 In the dead of night, your eyes so green
 I know places
 And I know for you, it's always me
 I know placesThe drought was the very worst
 When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
 It was months, and months of back and forth
 You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
 
 Hung my head as I lost the war, and the sky turned black like a perfect storm
 
 Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
 That's when I could finally breathe
 And by morning gone was any trace of you,
 I think I am finally clean
 
 There was nothing left to do
 When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
 So I punched a hole in the roof
 Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
 
 The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing
 
 Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
 That's when I could finally breathe
 And by morning, gone was any trace of you,
 I think I am finally clean
 I think I am finally clean
 Said I think I am finally clean
 
 10 months sober, I must admit
 Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
 10 months older, I won't give in
 Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it
 
 The drought was the very worst
 When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
 
 Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
 That's when I could finally breathe
 And by morning gone was any trace of you,
 I think I am finally clean
 
 Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
 That's when I could finally breathe
 And by morning gone was any trace of you
 I think I am finally clean
 Finally clean
 Think I'm finally clean
 Think I'm finally cleanFlashing lights and we
 Took a wrong turn and we
 Fell down a rabbit hole.
 
 You held on tight to me
 'Cause nothing's as it seems
 I'm spinning out of control.
 
 Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
 Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
 Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
 
 Oh
 
 Didn't it all seem new and exciting?
 I felt your arms twisting around me
 I should have slept with one eye open at night.
 
 We found wonderland
 You and I got lost in it
 And we pretended it could last forever
 Eh
 We found wonderland
 You and I got lost in it
 And life was never worse but never better
 Eh eh
 
 Eh [5x]
 In wonderland
 Eh [5x]
 In wonderland
 Eh [5x]
 In wonderland
 Eh [5x]
 In wonderland
 
 So we went on our way
 Too in love to think straight
 All alone or so it seemed.
 
 But there were strangers watching
 And whispers turned to talking
 And talking turned to screams.
 
 Oh
 
 Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
 Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
 Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?
 
 Oh
 
 Didn't it all seem new and exciting?
 I felt your arms twisting around me
 It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind.
 
 But darling, we found wonderland
 You and I got lost in it
 And we pretended it could last forever
 Eh
 We found wonderland
 You and I got lost in it
 And life was never worse but never better
 Eh eh
 
 Eh [5x]
 In wonderland
 Eh [5x]
 In wonderland
 Eh [5x]
 In wonderland
 Eh [5x]
 In wonderland
 
 I reached for you but you were gone
 I knew I had to go back home
 You search the world for something else to make you feel like what we had
 And in the end in wonderland we both went mad.
 
 Oh
 
 We found wonderland
 You and I got lost in it
 And we pretended it could last forever (last forever)
 Eh eh
 We found wonderland
 You and I got lost in it (got lost in it)
 And life was never worse but never better (never better)
 Eh eh
 
 We found wonderland
 You and I got lost in it (wonderland)
 And we pretended it could last forever (in wonderland)
 
 We found wonderland
 You and I got lost in it (wonderland)
 And life was never worse but never better
 In wonderlandOne look, dark room
 Meant just for you
 Time moved too fast
 You play it back
 Buttons on a coat
 Lighthearted joke
 No proof, not much
 But you saw enough
 Small talk, he drives
 Coffee at midnight
 The light reflects
 The chain on your neck
 He says look up
 And your shoulders brush
 No proof, one touch
 You felt enough
 
 You can hear it in the silence, silence
 You can feel it on the way home, way home
 You can see it with the lights out, lights out
 You are in love, true love
 You are in love
 
 Morning, his place
 Burn toast, Sunday
 You keep his shirt
 He keeps his word
 And for once you let go
 Of your fears and your ghosts
 One step, not much
 But it said enough
 You kiss on sidewalks
 You fight and you talk
 One night he wakes
 Strange look on his face
 Pauses, then says
 You're my best friend
 And you knew what it was
 He is in love
 
 You can hear it in the silence, silence
 You can feel it on the way home, way home
 You can see it with the lights out, lights out
 You are in love, true love
 
 And so it goes
 You two are dancing in a snow globe round and round
 And he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown
 And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
 And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words
 
 'Cause you can hear it in the silence
 You can feel it on the way home
 You can see it with the lights out
 You are in love, true love
 You're in love
 
 You can hear it in the silence, silence
 You can feel it on the way home, way home
 You can see it with the lights out, lights out
 You are in love, true love
 You're in love
 
 You can hear it in the silence, silence
 You can feel it on the way home, way home
 You can see it with the lights out, lights out
 You are in love, true love
 You're in loveWe're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
 We wait for trains that just aren't coming
 We show off our different scarlet letters
 Trust me, mine is better
 
 We're so young but we're on the road to ruin
 We play dumb but we know exactly what we're doing
 We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
 Honey, life is just a classroom
 
 'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
 Out of all the bricks they threw at me
 And every day is like a battle
 But every night with us is like a dream
 
 Baby, we're the new romantics
 Come on, come along with me
 Heart break is the national anthem
 We sing it proudly
 We are too busy dancing
 To get knocked off our feet
 Baby, we're the new romantics
 The best people in life are free
 
 We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
 We hang back, it's all in the timing
 It's poker, he can't see it in my face
 But I'm about to play my Ace
 
 We need love, but all we want is danger
 We team up then switch sides like a record changer
 The rumors are terrible and cruel
 But, honey, most of them are true
 
 'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
 Out of all the bricks they threw at me
 And every day is like a battle
 But every night with us is like a dream
 
 Baby, we're the new romantics
 Come on, come along with me
 Heart break is the national anthem
 We sing it proudly
 We are too busy dancing
 To get knocked off our feet
 Baby, we're the new romantics
 The best people in life are free
 
 So come on, come along with me
 The best people in life are free
 
 Please take my hand and
 Please take me dancing and
 Please leave me stranded,
 It's so romantic
 
 'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
 Out of all the bricks they threw at me
 And every day is like a battle
 But every night with us is like a dream
 
 'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
 Out of all the bricks they threw at me
 And every day is like a battle
 But every night with us is like a dream
 
 Baby, we're the new romantics
 Come on, come along with me
 Heart break is the national anthem
 We sing it proudly
 We are too busy dancing
 To get knocked off our feet
 Baby, we're the new romantics
 The best people in life are freeThe way you look, the way you laugh,
 The way you love with all you have,
 There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
 
 Once I thought that love was something I could never do
 Never knew that I could feel this much
 But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
 Is more than a reaction to your touch
 It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough
 
 The way you look, the way you laugh,
 The way you love with all you have,
 There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
 The way you kiss, The way you cry,
 The way you move when you walk by
 There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
 That don't do something for me
 
 wahooahoo
 
 In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
 That never knocked me off my feet
 All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
 And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
 Girl you got everything
 
 The way you look, the way you laugh,
 The way you love with all you have,
 There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
 The way you kiss, The way you cry,
 The way you move when you walk by
 There ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
 That don't do something for me
 
 I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
 Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on
 
 The way you look, the way you laugh,
 The way you love with all you have,
 There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
 The way you kiss, The way you cry,
 The way you move when you walk by
 There ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
 That don't do something for me
 
 The way you look, the way you laugh,
 The way you love with all you have,
 Your dance, your drive, You make me feel alive
 
 The way you talk, the way you tease
 By now I think you see that
 There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for meAll the other kids with the pumped up kicks
 You better run
 You better run
 Outrun my gun
 
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
 You better run
 You better run
 Faster than my bullet
 
 Ellen works a long day
 Giving weird interviews in a slick, cool sweater
 And it gets kinda weird
 Yeah, calling us like we're boyfriend and girlfriend
 
 But it's not cause were just sitting here
 And we got cat videos and dance on Betty White and stuff
 And it's always gonna get weird
 Cause this song is all about Ellen
 
 Every single time I come on this show
 It's really weird
 Really weird
 All because of Ellen
 
 Every single time I come on this show
 It's really weird
 Really weird
 Always end up dancing
 
 I've been on this show
 Eight times now and I still remember
 Ellen hiding in the bathroom with a hidden camera
 And she scared me so bad and I fell and I could of died
 
 She's always asks me who I'm dating
 Every time I'm on this show
 And I don't even know why
 But it gets five million hits on youtube
 
 Cause, Every single time I come on this show
 It's really weird
 Really weird
 All because of Ellen
 
 Every single time I come on this show
 It's really weird
 Really weird
 Always end up dancingI wake up, I stretch out
 I wonder what you're doing right now
 Yeah, I slept in my makeup again
 Tell myself I must be crazy, 
 Thinking about him
 
 I find myself something decent to wear
 Take the towel out of my hair
 About that time, you call me
 And I'm reminded, without you I'd be
 
 [Chorus]
 A stranger in an all night diner
 Waiting for her love to find her
 Lonely like a harbor line
 Thats never seen a boat
 Just like a line in an old love letter
 No one wrote
 
 I go to work, work all day
 I'm a walking tape recorder of everything you say
 Walk to my car, dig out my keys
 Start thinking if you were with anyone but me
 
 [Chorus]
 
 There you are, on the street
 Standing there all waiting on me
 Yeah, I show you, my new shoes
 You say you love em, and baby without you,
 I'd be
 
 [Chorus]
 
 I wake up, I stretch out
 Wonder what you're doing right nowSometimes I wonder how it's gonna feel
 Will my first love be true and real?
 Will I be ready when my heart starts to fall?
 What will I do when my love comes to call?
 And my daddy tells me that I light up his world
 Everyday he says, darling you're my best girl
 He tried to teach me from the very start
 The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart
 
 Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
 Will it be filled with hope and desire?
 Will my love come in a pouring rain?
 Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
 Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love
 
 I know I'm not a little girl anymore
 Cause I'm feeling things I've never felt before
 Sweet sensations and anticipations
 Calling commotion to my emotions
 And I hear the words my daddy said to me
 He said be true 2 yourself & keep your spirit free
 And love will find you one way or another
 Be good to yourself and be good to each other
 
 Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
 Will it be filled with hope and desire?
 Will my love come in a pouring rain?
 Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
 Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love
 
 It's a run around the world
 And it's moving so fast
 Though I wanna find
 A love that's gonna last
 A love so strong
 That I can withstand
 The weight of the world
 In the palm of its hand
 
 Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
 Will it be filled with hope and desire?
 Will my love come in a pouring rain?
 Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
 Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for this game
 Am I ready for the kiss, am I ready for the stars
 Am I ready for the bliss, am I ready for loveAmerican boy, living life as it goes
 Sittin' on the fence posts
 Living in the lie
 American boy, living in the real world
 Trying just to get the girl
 Trying to survive
 
 [Chorus:]
 The simple things in life are always new
 growing up on Sam Hill avenue
 Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
 the greatest living hero that ever was
 Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
 the hope of an american boy
 
 Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships
 looking for the love
 Suddenly rise, an american beauty
 suddenly he cheats, sent from above
 
 [Chorus:]
 The simple things in life are always new
 growing up on Sam Hill avenue
 Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
 the greatest living hero that ever was
 Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
 the dream of an american boy
 
 American boy, raising little babies
 hearing daddy maybe, I'll be like you
 Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn
 that's grown up, american boy
 
 [Chorus:]
 The simple things in life are always new
 growing up on Grandview avenue
 Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
 the greatest living hero that ever was
 Nothing in the world will ever once destroy
 No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy
 the hope of an american boyWell, she was an American girl
 Raised on promises
 She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life
 Somewhere else
 
 After all it was a great big world
 With lots of places to run to
 And if she had to die trying
 She had one little promise she was gonna keep
 
 Oh yeah, all right
 Take it easy baby
 Make it last all night
 She was an American girl
 
 Well, it was kind of cold that night
 She stood alone on her balcony
 She could see the cars roll by
 Out on 441
 Like waves crashing on the beach
 
 And for one desperate moment there
 He crept back in her memory
 God, it's so painful
 It's something that's so close but still so far out of reach
 
 Oh yeah, all right
 Take it easy baby
 Make it last all night
 She was an American girl
 
 Oh yeah, all right
 Take it easy baby
 Make it last all night
 Oh yeah, all right
 Take it easy baby
 Oh, take it easy now
 
 Oh yeah, all right
 She was an American girlAngelinas got a pretty face

 Every time the things got rocky, yeah
 
 I was believing in you
 Was I mistaken?
 Do you mean,
 Do you mean what you say?
 When you say our love could last forever
 
 Well, I'd rather you be mean
 Than love and lie
 I'd rather hear the truth
 Than have to say goodbye
 I'd rather take a blow
 At least then I would know
 But baby don't you break my heart slow
 
 I like the way you'd hold me

 And lead me on forever
 While I stay at home
 Still thinking we're together
 I want our love to last forever
 
 But I'd rather you be mean
 Than love and lie
 I'd rather hear the truth
 Than have to say goodbye
 And I'd rather take a blow
 At least then I would know
 But baby don't you break my heart slow
 Now baby don't you break my heart
 Slow[Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
 'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
 You know it used to be mad love
 So take a look what you've done
 'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
 
 [Verse 1 - Kendrick Lamar:]
 Hey! I can't take it back, look where I'm at!
 We was on D like DOC, remember that? (Remember that)
 My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts (ID my)
 Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
 I don't hate you but I hate to critique, overrate you
 These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
 Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
 No I don't fear no more, better yet respect ain't quite sincere no more
 
 [Pre-Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
 Oh, it's so sad to
 Think about the good times
 You and I
 
 [Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
 'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
 You know it used to be mad love
 So take a look what you've done
 'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
 Now we got problems
 And I don't think we can solve 'em
 You made a really deep cut
 And baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
 
 [Verse 2 - Kendrick Lamar:]
 Hey! Remember when you tried to write me off?
 Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
 Don't you remember? You thought that I would need yah
 Follow procedure, remember? Oh wait you got amnesia?
 It was my season for battle wounds, battle scars
 Body bumped, bruised
 Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
 Still, all my life, I got money and power
 And you gotta live with the bad blood now
 
 [Pre-Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
 Oh, it's so sad to
 Think about the good times
 You and I
 
 [Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
 'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
 You know it used to be mad love
 So take a look what you've done
 'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
 Now we got problems
 And I don't think we can solve 'em
 You made a really deep cut
 And baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
 
 [Bridge - Taylor Swift (Kendrick Lamar):]
 Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
 You say sorry just for show
 If you live like that, you live with ghosts
 (You forgive, you forget but you never let it go)
 Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
 You say sorry just for show
 If you live like that you live with ghosts
 If you love like that blood runs cold
 
 [Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
 'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
 You know it used to be mad love
 So take a look what you've done
 'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey!

 You made a really deep cut
 And baby, now we got bad blood, hey!

 So baby, make me fly
 My heart has never felt this way before

 In only a little while... I'll cry
 Cause you're my lullaby

 Dream about your eyes
 Eyes, Eyes...Beautiful eyesAll is quiet in the world tonight
 Catching stars and fireflies
 The summer sings a lullaby
 With just me and my baby
 On the hood of his daddy's car
 Pass around his old guitar
 Bet mama's wondering where we are
 It's just me and my baby
 The world is spinning round
 Cause look just what I've found
 
 Ooh, life's so sweet right here
 Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
 Ooh, just wanna stay right here
 Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby
 
 Driving home by the river side
 Wishing I could slow down time
 Taking pictures in my mind
 Both me and my baby
 The car pulls up and I'm home too late
 We didn't take that interstate
 Back roads was a better way
 For me and my baby
 The closer that we get
 Oh, I can't leave yet
 
 Ooh, life's so sweet right here
 Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
 Ooh, just wanna stay right here
 Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby
 
 Look at what we've found
 So turn that car around
 
 Ooh, life's so sweet right here
 Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
 Ooh, just wanna stay right here
 Ooh, hanging with my baby
 Hanging with my baby, my babyHer hair is Harlow gold, her lips sweet surprise
 Her hands are never cold, she's got Bette Davis eyes
 She'll turn the music on you, you won't have to think twice
 She's pure as New York snow, she got Bette Davis eyes
 And she'll tease you, she'll unease you
 All the better just to please you
 She's precocious
 And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
 She got Greta Garbo standoff sighs, she's got Bette Davis eyes
 She'll let you take her home, it whets her appetite
 She'll lay you on the throne, she got Bette Davis eyes
 She'll take a tumble on you, roll you like you were dice
 Until you come up blue, she's got Bette Davis eyes
 She'll expose you, when she snows you
 Hope you'll feed with the crumbs she throws you
 She's ferocious
 And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
 All the boys think she's a spy, she's got Bette Davis eyes
 And she'll tease you, she'll unease you
 All the better just to please you
 She's precocious
 And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
 All the boys think she's a spy, she's got Bette Davis eyes
 She'll tease you, she'll unease you
 Just to please you, she's got Bette Davis eyes
 She'll expose you when she snows you
 She knows you, she's got Bette Davis EyesI live down the street in a broken down house
 And a car up on blocks in the driveway
 The moment we meet, there was never a doubt
 That we won't forget this Sunday
 It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles
 And it all leads to this - our first kiss
 
 All my friends are saying 
 Girl, what are you thinking?
 You're better off, 
 you're better off without him
 Find yourself another
 Girl, that boy is trouble
 You're better off, you're better off
 They can talk forever, they just don't know better
 
 We drive around town in a rusty old truck
 Somehow it feels like we're flying
 Don't wanna come down
 But they make it so tough
 'Cause everyone we know is trying
 To push us apart hide it down in our hearts
 And they get what they want cause you're gone
 
 All my friends are saying
 Girl, why are you crying?
 You're better off, you're better off without him
 Find yourself another
 Girl, that boy is trouble
 You're better off, you're better off
 They can talk forever, they just don't know better
 
 You come to my door
 In the pouring rain
 We know what we don't have to say
 You hand me a rose and a note that says
 We don't have to do things their way
 
 All my friends are saying
 Girl, what are you thinking?
 You're better off, you're better off without him
 Find yourself another
 Girl, that boy is trouble
 You're better off, you're better off
 Well, they can talk forever, they just don't know betterHere you are now
 Fresh from your war
 Back from the edge of time
 And all that you were
 Stripped to the bone
 I thought you'd want to know
 
 That when you feel the world is crashing
 All around your feet
 Come running headlong into my arms
 Breathless
 I'll never judge you
 I can only love you
 Come now running headlong
 Into my arms
 Breathless
 
 Lay down your guns
 Too weak to run
 Nothing can harm you here
 Your precious heart
 Broken and scarred
 Somehow you made it through
 I only ask that you won't go again
 
 When you feel the world is crashing
 All around your feet
 Come running headlong into my arms
 Breathless
 I'll never judge you
 I can only love you
 Come now running headlong
 Into my arms
 Breathless
 
 I'm so glad to see you smiling
 So good to hear your laugh
 I think that you've found you even
 Missed yourself
 I'm only asking this because I think that
 Truth be told
 Oh, you'll never go again
 Again
 
 When you feel the world is crashing
 All around your feet
 Come running headlong into my arms
 Breathless
 I'll never judge you
 I can only love you
 Come now running headlong
 Into my arms
 Breathless
 BreathlessEmily comes home from school,
 Grabs onto her daddy's hand,
 He says, "Baby girl, what's wrong with you?"
 She says, "Please, don't make me go back there again."
 
 She said, "I wish there was some way
 To make them stop it."
 So he drives down to
 That principles office and says,
 
 "I didn't bring her up
 So they could cut her down.
 I didn't bring her here
 So they could shut her out.
 I live my whole damn life
 To see that little girl's smile.
 So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?
 She wasn't brought up that way."
 
 Emily's home late again
 He sees that boy drive away
 Oh, but something's different this time,
 She doesn't have too much to say
 She said, "He tried but there's just some things I won't do."
 And through the tears she said, "I couldn't do that to you."
 And he said,
 
 "I didn't bring you up
 So he could wear you down.
 Take that innocent heart
 And turn it inside out.
 I live my whole damn life
 To see my little girl's smile.
 So don't let nobody take that away.
 You weren't brought up that way."
 
 The phone rings on a rainy night
 Says, "It's officer Tate."
 He said, "Sir, there's been an accident.
 You better come down here right away.
 A drunken driver missed an over pass.
 And Emily  she's fading fast."
 
 He says, "God, I didn't bring her up
 To watch them lay her down.
 Nearly killed me the day
 They put her momma in the ground.
 Only thing that kept me alive
 Was that little girl's smile.
 So please don't take that away.
 It won't be easy taking her today.
 She wasn't brought up that way."
 
 He stands over the hospital bed
 Emily opens her eyesI had to catch my breath
 When I saw you there across the room
 Holding her hand
 I'd have never guessed
 That starting over would look so good on you
 But here I am
 Still believing there might come a day
 We'll pick up where we left off
 
 And by the way
 Your eyes are dancing
 I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
 By the way
 My heart's still breaking
 It's gonna take it a while to love again
 So many things that I forgot to say
 By the way
 
 I should've let you know
 All the ways you made me feel alive
 I guess it's too late
 So I'll just get my coat
 And make my way into this breezy night
 Give you one last wave
 Maybe you'll drop what you're doing
 And come over here to say 
 I'm looking good
 
 But by the way
 Your eyes are dancing
 I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
 By the way
 My heart's still breaking
 It's gonna take it a while to love again
 So many things that I forgot to say
 
 By the way
 You still look amazing
 And I must've been crazy to let you get away
 By the way
 If you ever wondered
 Still got the same old number; just in case
 I still miss you
 And i still love you
 By the way
 By the way, ohAny day now, they're talking war
 I can see the look that's in your eyes
 They're not talking a week or two
 Oh, daddy can I go with you?
 Oh, daddy can I go with you?
 
 You pack a suitcase, take a picture from the wall
 I always knew this time would come
 When I ask how long you think you're gonna be
 You say, this crazy world's come undone
 
 Summer's over and leaves begin to fall
 And another winter's on the way
 I knew I wasn't gonna take this very well
 But I'd give anything to have you here today
 
 Everyday now they're talking war
 & I know this time is like it's never been before
 We're not talking about a week or two
 
 Oh, daddy can I go with you?
 Oh, daddy can I go with you?
 Oh, daddy can I go with you?I drive around this town
 In a Mustang with the top down
 And six running horses under my hood
 Well thats good enough for me
 Dont need the real thing
 Thats just another thing 
 For me to try to tame
 Dont know if I could
 It might just break me
 I thought there for a little while
 Every sunset Id be a riding off with him
 
 Snap buttons on a denim shirt
 Blue jeans and a little dirt
 Thats the closest youll see me
 Feet hanging out a pickup truck
 Crazy and a little rough
 Running free
 Thats the closest to a cowboy
 Youll see me
 
 Before I met him 
 I was so sane and grounded
 Before he taught me how to lie
 And crawl out the window
 I learned the dirt roads
 And I got my heart broken
 Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
 And how to let go
 I thought there for a little while
 Every sunset Id be a riding off with him
 
 Snap buttons on a denim shirt
 Blue jeans and a little dirt
 Thats the closest youll see me
 Feet hanging out a pickup truck
 Crazy and a little rough
 Running free
 Thats the closest to a cowboy
 Youll see me
 
 It was all a little
 Wonderful and strange
 But Ill never look
 At a sunset the same night
 
 Snap buttons on a denim shirt
 Blue jeans and a little dirt
 Thats the closest youll see me
 Feet hanging out a pickup truck
 Crazy and a little rough
 Running free
 Sitting fishing by the river bank
 Swimming in the water tank
 Thats the closest youll see me
 Feet hanging out a pickup truck
 Crazy and a little rough
 Running free
 Thats the closest to a cowboy
 Youll see meI'd never gone with the wind
 Just let it flow
 Let it take me where it wants to go
 'Til you open the door
 There's so much more
 I'd never seen it before
 I was trying to fly
 But I couldn't find wings
 But you came along and you changed everything
 
 [Chorus:]
 You lift my feet off the ground
 You spin me around
 You make me crazier, crazier
 Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
 You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
 
 I've watched from a distance as you made life your own
 Every sky was your own kind of blue
 And I wanted to know how that would feel
 And you made it so real
 You showed me something that I couldn't see
 You opened my eyes
 And you made me believe
 
 [Chorus]
 
 Baby you showed me what living is for
 I don't wanna hide anymore
 Oh oh
 
 You lift my feet off the ground
 You spin me around
 You make me crazier, crazier
 Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
 You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
 Crazier, crazier.Ive been counting days and
 Ive been being patient
 About a little thing called love
 Crossing all my fingers
 Letting my heart linger
 Trying to get some help from up above
 I dont want to jinx my luck
 Ive left it all behind me
 And Ive been hoping every day
 That someday you will find me
 
 So I cross my heart and hope for you
 Knock on wood and rope the moon
 Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
 And I wait around that old wishing well
 You never know if time will tell
 I cross my heart and hope for you tonight
 
 Dreaming of you baby
 Ive been thinking maybe
 There is something I can do
 Cause Ive been on the verge of
 Running around in circles
 Baby all I want is you
 
 I dont want to jinx my luck
 Ive left it all behind me
 And Ive been hoping every day
 That someday you will find me
 
 So I cross my heart and hope for you
 Knock on wood and rope the moon
 Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
 And I wait around that old wishing well
 You never know if time will tell
 I cross my heart and hope for you tonight
 
 Do you believe in miracles
 Please tell me if youve seen one
 Id like to know just where to go
 Because I think I need one
 
 So I cross my heart and hope for you
 Knock on wood and rope the moon
 Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
 And I wait around that old wishing well
 You never know if time will tell
 I cross my heart and hope for you tonight
 
 So I cross my heart and hope for you
 Knock on wood and rope the moon
 Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
 And I wait around that old wishing well
 You never know if time will tell
 I cross my heart and hope for you tonightHe said, "I got me a nice new apartment
 In a city, wouldn't you have hated that?
 I'm getting by with a broken heart you left me with."
 He hangs up the phone and she whispers back,
 
 Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
 Won't you come back to me?
 I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
 In dark blue Tennessee
 
 He was lying when he said he moved to L.A.
 He's just hiding out on the other side of town
 With his head in his hands and she's just 7 miles away
 He's staring out the window and puts her picture down saying,
 
 Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
 Won't you come back to me?
 I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
 In dark blue Tennessee
 
 She almost called him on the night that he wrote
 These simple words on his goodbye note
 
 Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
 Won't you come back to me?
 I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
 In dark blue Tennessee
 
 In dark blue TennesseeShe walks to school with her arms crossed
 It's just another day
 At 10 o'clock she hears this screaming
 Then finally she sees them
 It's scary how things change
 
 And I saw the story on the news
 I saw the footage from the roof
 I sat down and cried
 
 Didn't she call you?
 Didn't she need you bad enough?
 Was there some reason I'm not aware of?
 Did you not write it down
 Just one more thing to do
 Where were you
 And didn't she pray too
 
 He kissed his wife good bye
 And took the earliest flight
 So he could be home that night
 To put his kids to sleep
 Down the aisle three men walked and said,
 "We're here to die for our God."
 He stood up and said, "That's funny,
 'Cause my God died for me."
 
 I put the magazine down
 I read his words out loud
 I sat down and cried
 
 Didn't he call you?
 Didn't he need you bad enough?
 Was there some reason I'm not aware of?
 Did you not write it down?
 Just one more thing to do
 Where were you?
 And didn't he pray too?
 
 The taxis pulled up on the very day of
 They rode 100 floors up just to come back down
 They never thought they'd see the day
 That the towers up in flames
 There was nothing left to say when it all came down
 
 And didn't they call you?
 Didn't they need you bad enough?
 Was there some reason I'm not aware of?
 Did you not write it down?
 Just one more thing to do
 Where were you? Where were you?
 And didn't they pray too?
 
 I walk to school and I wear a cross
 I'm counting every dayMy momma stood across the room
 Face to face but never eye to eye
 Recalling words we said
 The battle that we swore
 We'd never fight
 Breaking pieces off with every lie
 A tear came to her eye
 And she said
 
 Don't walk away now
 And don't rip my heart out
 Don't you block me out tonight
 Honey where are you?
 And don't hate me for loving you
 
 He walked around my life
 And made blind
 With every single move
 He caught me staring at him
 Mad about him
 Little that I knew 
 Love is different
 When you play the fool
 And all I wanna do is say
 
 Don't walk away now
 And don't rip my heart out
 Don't you make cry tonight
 Like you always do
 And don't hate me for loving you
 
 I slammed the door
 Sat on the floor
 Cried into my bed
 Said are you there?
 Do you even care?
 To cross above my head
 But someone said
 
 Don't turn away now
 And don't rip my heart out
 Things are meant to happen like this
 I know it's right for you
 And don't hate me for loving you
 
 I looked up at the sky
 Face to face and finally
 Eye to eyeHere in my mind the sky looks the same
 On every day you loved me 
 When we started home it started to rain 
 You put your coat around me 
 We stood there in the road 
 You held me so close 
 But did you ever let go 
 
 Down came the rain 
 Lightning and thunder 
 We tried in vain 
 To hold on to each other 
 Winds of change blew you away from me 
 Right here right now, I feel it on my skin 
 The bitter sting of what we couldve been 
 Just when our love was like a burning flame 
 Down came the rain 
 
 In through the window I see her with you 
 Im soaked to the skin, youre warm and dry 
 I guess the storm is over for you 
 But look at the tears here in my eyes 
 I just stood there like a ghost 
 As you held her so close 
 And as I let you go 
 
 Down came the rain 
 Lightning and thunder 
 We tried in vain 
 To hold on to each other 
 Winds of change blew you away from me 
 Love like this changes who you are 
 Every kiss you gave me is a scar 
 Just when our love was like a burning flame 
 Down came the rain 
 
 All I need is to move on fast 
 But all I want is to have you back 
 And it just keeps falling 
 
 Down came the rain 
 Lightning and thunder 
 We tried in vain 
 To hold on to each other 
 Winds of change blew you away from me 
 Right here right now, I feel it on my skin 
 The bitter sting of what we couldve been 
 Just when our love was like a burning flame 
 Down came the rain 
 
 Down came the rain[Spoken:] You know you guys have a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world, did you know that?
 
 Well now he's back in the atmosphere
 With Drops of Jupiter in his hair, hey, hey
 He walks like summer and talks like rain
 Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey
 Since his return from the stay on the moon
 He listens like spring and he talks like June, hey, hey 
 
 Tell me did you sail across the sun
 Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
 That heaven is overrated 
 
 Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
 One without a permanent scar
 And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there 
 
 Well now he's back from that soul vacation
 Chasing his way through the constellation, hey, hey
 He checks out Mozart while he does tae-bo
 Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey 
 
 Well now he's back in the atmosphere
 I'm afraid that he might think of me as plain ol' Jane
 Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land 
 
 Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
 Did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day
 Head back to the Milky Way
 And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
 Was it everything you wanted to find
 And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there 
 
 Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
 Your best friend always sticking up for you, even when I know you're wrong
 Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
 The best soy latte that you ever had. . .and me.
 
 Tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet
 Did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day
 Head back toward the Milky Way
 Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
 One without a permanent scar
 And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?
 
 Na na na na na na na na na na na na naaa, oh oh ohhh
 Na na na na na na na na na na na na naaa, oh oh ohhh
 
 Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
 Your best friend always sticking up for you, even when I know you're wrong.
 Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
 The best soy latte that you ever had. . .and me.Everybody's waiting
 Everybody's watching
 Even when you're sleeping
 Keep your ey-eyes open
 
 The tricky thing
 Is yesterday we were just children
 Playing soldiers
 Just pretending
 Dreaming dreams with happy endings
 In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
 But now we've stepped into a cruel world
 Where everybody stands and keeps score
 
 Keep your eyes open
 
 Everybody's waiting for you to break down
 Everybody's watching to see the fallout
 Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
 Keep your ey-eyes open
 Keep your ey-eyes open
 Keep your ey-eyes open
 
 So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
 Every lesson forms a new scar
 They never thought you'd make it this far
 But turn around (turn around), oh they've surrounded you
 It's a showdown (showdown) and nobody comes to save you now
 But you've got something they don't
 Yeah you've got something they don't
 You've just gotta keep your eyes open
 
 Everybody's waiting for you to break down
 Everybody's watching to see the fallout
 Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
 Keep your ey-eyes open
 Keep your ey-eyes open
 Keep your ey-eyes
 
 Keep your feet ready
 Heartbeat steady
 Keep your eyes open
 Keep your aim locked
 The night goes dark
 Keep your eyes open
 
 (Keep your eyes open [4x])
 
 Everybody's waiting for you to break down
 Everybody's watching to see the fallout
 Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
 
 Keep your ey-eyes open
 Keep your ey-eyes open
 Keep your ey-eyes open
 Keep your ey-eyes open
 Keep your ey-eyes openIsn't it funny how many times we can say,
 We drawn the line, cross it out, turn the page,
 And moved on
 That's what we thought
 
 But here I am in the same old car,
 Having myself another same old brown-eyed bar
 Uh oh, uh oh,
 
 I won't tell nobody
 I won't tell my friends
 We'll just drive down this road till the one we're on ends
 And we'll tell each other things like I need you
 
 You and me
 Baby this is what we do
 I may see
 There are people you just come back to
 So fall back on me
 Fall back on you
 
 You always let someone come in between
 Your talking round the truth and never say what we mean
 Look at all this wasted time
 
 I won't tell nobody
 I won't tell my friend
 We'll just drive down this road and pray it doesn't end
 And we'll tell each other things, like I love you
 
 You and me
 Baby this is what we do
 I may see
 There are people who you come back to
 So fall back on me,
 Fall back on you
 
 Maybe we'll last
 Maybe we won't
 Maybe we'll stop talking and I'll haunt you like a ghost
 But just, baby, get along with me
 
 You and me
 Baby this is what we do
 I may see
 There are people that you come back too
 Fall back on me
 Baby I'll fall back on you
 Fall back on me baby,
 Baby I'll fall back on you
 Fall back on you
 
 Fall back on youSomeone struck a match against the night,
 All I could see was you and I.
 I was captivated.
 A perfect little dream inside my head,
 And then reality crept in, and erased it.
 
 For a while I thought that I could hold you,
 But you were just a temporary high. 
 
 Firefly you drew me to you,
 Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
 And you don't know it, do you?
 I wish I could keep you, firefly
 Firefly
 
 Something so beautiful and free,
 Was as never meant to be caged in
 I thought I had you in my hand,
 I tried to catch you, but I can't 
 Chase the wind
 
 And just as I reach out to touch you,
 I remind myself you were meant to fly.
 
 Firefly you drew me to you,
 Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
 And you don't know it, do you?
 I wish I could keep you firefly
 Firefly
 
 I like to think I'd be all that you wanted
 Not even that is enough
 
 Firefly you drew me to you
 Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
 And you don't know it do you?
 I wish I could keep you
 I wish I could keep you,  firefly
 FireflyMy name's Gracie
 I'll be five in May
 Kinda scared 'cause
 I never been on a plane
 My mama says that it'll be alright
 'Cause I'm gunna see my daddy tonight
 And she says that
 
 There's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
 An' I don't wanna get there too soon
 And I know there's a God because I met him
 And I see it when I'm looking at you
 There ain't no accidents in what we do
 
 My name's Heather
 Guess we're on the same flight
 Don't mind Gracie
 She could talk to you all night
 She's finally well enough to travel
 doctor says she's in the clear
 She's been in and out of hospital
 Since the beginning of the year
 
 And there's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
 But none of us want to get there too soon
 And I know there's a God because I met him
 And I see it when I'm looking at you
 There ain't no accidents in what we do
 
 James T. Johnson
 That's her daddy's name
 He's been overseas
 It'll be a year today
 He never talked about being scared over the phone
 He just said me and Gracie will come and take him on
 
 There's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
 And I don't wanna get there too soon
 And I know there's a God because I met him
 And I see it when I'm looking at you
 There ain't no accidents in what we do
 
 And the people that we meet
 As we go through the rain
 There are no accidents in what we doWish I had concentrated,
 They said love was complicated,
 But it's something i just fell into, 
 
 And it was over-rated
 But just look what i've created
 I came out alive but i'm black and blue-ue
 
 Before you ask me if i'm alright, 
 Think about what i, 
 Had to do-oo, yeah
 
 Wake up and smell the break-up
 Fix my heart, put on my make-up
 Another mess i didn't plan, 
 And i'll bet, you thought you'd beat me, 
 Wish you could only see, 
 I've got an i heart question mark, 
 Written on the back of my hand.
 
 I'd be fine if you just walked by, 
 But you had to talk about why, 
 You were wrong and i was right, 
 
 But i can't believe you made me, 
 Sit at home and cry like a baby, 
 Wait right by the phone every night, 
 
 And now you ask about you and i, 
 There's no you and i, 
 Remember what you put me through, 
 I had to, 
 
 Wake up and smell the break-up, 
 Fix my heart put on my make-up, 
 Another mess i didn't plan, 
 And i'll bet, you thought you'd beat me
 I wish you'd could only see
 I got an i heart question mark, 
 Written on the back of my hand 
 
 And when you're home alone at night, 
 You'll still wonder 
 Why you took everything i had, oh baby
 I had a lot about you and i, 
 There's no you and i, 
 And i know, 
 Someday you will...
 
 Wake up and smell the break-up, 
 Realize that we won't make-up
 It didn't go the way you planed, 
 
 And you'll know you didn't beat me, 
 When you look down and see, 
 I've got an i heart question mark 
 Written on the back of my hand, 
 
 Written on the back of my hand
 An i heart question mark, yeah
 Written on the back of my hand[Taylor Swift:]
 Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
 I was in your sights, you got me alone
 You found me, you found me, you found me
 I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
 And when I fell hard you took a step back
 Without me, without me, without me
 
 And he's long gone when he's next to me
 And I realize the blame is on me
 
 'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 So shame on me now
 Flew me to places I'd never been
 'Til you put me down, oh
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 So shame on me now
 Flew me to places I'd never been
 Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
 Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm)
 Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble
 Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] I told you I was, I was) trouble, trouble, trouble
 Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
 
 [Sammy Adams:]
 Double platinum wherever she go
 South of France to Reno
 Met her out in Vegas
 Went in on casino 
 Red lips so hard to miss
 What's wrong with being promiscuous
 And I can teach you bad, bad things
 If you into it
 Don't need to get intimate...just yet
 Slow down, I know that 
 You thinking you and me...just met 
 But girl, I got the remedy most important in chemistry
 Good girl gone bad too much for a Kennedy
 
 Some say, some say, they sell they souls for a couple hits
 I'd rather live a life of gold with a perfect chick
 Cause that one moment when your breathless and your hoping
 And ya feel the same way, same way 
 Sparks blowing off that cute face and that shy smile...oh man 
 I haven't crushed this hard in quite a while...oh damn
 And I can care less that your famous
 We can make the perfect couple
 Cause my first name big, last name trouble
 Yeah
 
 [Taylor Swift:]
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 So shame on me now
 Flew me to places I'd never been
 'Til you put me down, oh
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 So shame on me now
 Flew me to places I'd never been
 Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
 Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm)
 Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble
 
 And the saddest fear comes creeping in
 That you never loved me, or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah
 
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 So shame on me now
 Flew me to places I'd never been
 'Til you put me down, oh
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there, you were right there)
 So shame on me now
 Flew me to places I'd never been
 Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
 Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
 Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
 
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 Trouble, trouble, trouble
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 Trouble, trouble, troubleI like my music loud
 I like my windows down
 So I can scream
 
 I like my trucks a little
 Bigger than the rest
 So I can see
 
 Dont try me
 Dont fight me
 You be you and Ill be me
 
 They say Ive always known
 What I wanted
 My friends and enemies
 Will tell you its true
 You will find out
 I always get it
 I know what I want
 And it aint you
 
 Your mum and daddys walls
 Are covered up in pictures of you
 
 You never met a mirror
 That you didn't look again into
 
 So sorry, dont worry
 Im sure there are so many girls
 Who love you like you do
 
 They say Ive always known
 What I wanted
 My friends and enemies
 Will tell you its true
 You will find out
 I always get it
 I know what I want
 And it aint you
 And it aint you oh
 
 Oh baby, dont persuade me

 So let me say it real slow
 
 They say Ive always known

 And they say Ive always known
 What I wanted
 My friends and enemies
 Will tell you its true
 And youll will find out
 I always get it
 I know what I want
 And it aint youI... I used to fly
 Didn't matter where I'd been
 'Cause I'd seen the sky
 I wanna tell you why
 But somehow I know I
 Would break down and cry
 
 I know you can't see me here
 But I am not alone
 I'm lying here in invisible arms
 And I won't be alone tonight
 
 You... you know I would die
 Before I let them see me
 See me cry
 Please don't leave tonight
 Oh let me down slowly
 Show me a light
 
 I know you can't see me here
 But I am not alone
 I'm lying here in invisible arms
 And I won't be alone tonight
 
 Oh let me think I'm strong
 Please don't bring me down
 I need you tonight
 
 I know you can't see me here
 But I am not alone
 I'm lying here in invisible arms
 And I won't be alone tonight
 
 I... I used to fly
 Didn't matter where I'd been
 'Cause I'd seen the skyThrowing pennies at the fountain, 
 When you're standing on a mountain, 
 It's kinda hard to aim. 
 
 But like the trees we cut our names in, 
 There must be an explanation, 
 Guess it didn't given off rain. 
 I need reasons why you're leaving 
 
 [Chorus:]
 Well I guess I wished on a plane, 
 I thought was a star, 
 I guess what you wrote on a paper 
 Wasn't really from your heart 
 Could've sworn you said you loved me 
 I guess heard you wrong 
 And I guess I wished on a plane 
 And I thought was a star. 
 
 Diving off into the deep end, 
 Honestly believe you'd be there, 
 When I jumped in, 
 Is ain't your territory, 
 We had the perfect love story, 
 except ending. 
 Nothing comes true, 
 When it comes to you. 
 
 [Chorus:]
 Well I guess I wished on a plane,
 I thought was a star, 
 I guess what you wrote on a paper 
 Wasn't really from your heart 
 Could've sworn you said you loved me 
 I guess heard you wrong 
 And I guess I wished on a plane 
 And I thought it was a star. 
 
 And I was too cloudy, 
 It's not my fault I just couldn't see. 
 
 [Chorus:]
 Well I guess I wished on a plane, 
 I thought it was a star, 
 I guess what you wrote on a paper 
 Wasn't really in your heart
 Could've sworn you said you loved me 
 I guess heard you wrong 
 And I guess I wished on a plane 
 And I thought it was a star. 
 
 Throwing pennies at the fountain, 
 When you're standing on a mountain, 
 It's kinda hard to aim.I dont think that passenger seat
 Has ever looked this good to me
 He tells me about his night
 And I count the colors in his eyes
 Hell never fall in love he swears
 As he runs his fingers through his hair
 Im laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
 And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
 He tells a joke, I fake a smile
 But I know all his favorite songs
 And...
 
 [Chorus:]
 I could tell you his favorite color's green
 He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
 His sister's beautiful, he has his fathers eyes
 And if you asked me if I love him,
 Id lie
 
 He looks around the room
 Innocently overlooks the truth
 Shouldnt a light go on?
 Doesnt he know that Ive had him memorized for so long?
 He sees everything black and white
 Never let nobody see him cry
 I dont let nobody see me wishing he was mine
 
 [Chorus]
 
 He stands there, then walks away
 My god if I could only say,
 "Im holding every breath for you..."
 
 Hed never tell you but he can play guitar
 I think he can see through everything but my heart
 First thought when I wake up
 Is "My god, hes beautiful."
 So I put on my make-up
 And pray for a miracle
 
 Yes, I could tell you his favorite color's green
 He loves to argue, oh, and it kills me
 His sister's beautiful, he has his fathers eyes
 And if you asked me if I love him
 If you asked me if I love him
 Id lieShe didn't have a reason to go, oh no
 She didn't have a reason to stay
 Either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun
 She looked at her keys and found a reason to run
 
 And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
 But I understand it somehow
 
 If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
 Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
 And unfamiliar exit signs?
 I just drive on by, just south of knowing why
 
 I didn't really know her that well
 But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind
 She felt so out of touch, cos she just felt too much
 If you don't know what you want nothing's ever enough
 
 And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
 That's where I'm headed right now
 
 If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
 Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
 And unfamiliar exit signs?
 I just drive on by, just south of knowing why
 
 I don't have a plan, I don't have a map
 I don't even know if I'm ever going back
 I don't have a when and I don't have a where
 I don't even know if I'll know when I'm there
 
 But If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
 Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
 And unfamiliar exit signs?
 I just drive on by
 
 I just drive on by, drive on, drive on
 Drive all night
 If I drive on, drive on, drive on
 Drive all night, just south of knowing whyI got a lying smile I never put out for you
 Cause I guess I never felt like I really needed to
 And they say little girls have big dreams
 And nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you
 
 And it was a long time coming
 I waited half my life just to find someone like you
 I spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
 Not knowing it'd be a long time going
 
 They say it's better to have lost than never to have loved at all
 And I say, whoever said that didn't have too far to fall
 And they say little girls are so naive
 That wasn't how it was supposed to be with me and you
 
 And it was a long time coming
 I waited half my life just to find someone like you
 I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
 Not knowing it will be a long time going
 
 I've burned my bridges, had sleepless nights
 Washed my sins on the neon lights
 And I'm still not over you
 
 And it was a long time coming
 I waited half my life just to find someone like you
 I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
 Not knowing it will be a long time going
 
 A long time going
 
 And it will be a long time, long time going
 Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
 
 It will be a long time, long time going, going
 Oh-oh, oh-oh, ohCome on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out
 Sorry for the inconvenience, I didn't mean to let you down
 We were supposed to be forever but it's too bad you didn't see that to me
 You were the perfect view of misery
 
 I never talked about the tears I cried
 All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
 I never talked about the days he called
 There was something wrong, it was all my fault
 I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
 But in case you haven't heard the news
 There wasn't much love to lose
 
 Let's talk about that golden boy that I met on a winter night
 How was I supposed to know that he was just as cold inside
 He smiled and I smiled, well the camera's in your mind
 And I lied, I swore that everything was fine
 
 I never talked about the tears I cried
 All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
 I never talked about the nights he called
 There was something wrong, it was all my fault
 I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
 But in case you haven't heard the news
 There wasn't much love to lose
 
 I know you wanna talk about me
 How I gave up on love so foolishly
 But keep in mind
 
 I never talked about the tears I cried
 All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
 I never talked about the nights he called
 There was something wrong, it was all my fault
 I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
 But in case you haven't heard the news
 There wasn't much love to lose
 
 Come on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went outThere's a little girl in this little town
 With a little too much heart to go around
 Live forever, never say never
 You could do better, that's what she says
 
 Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
 A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
 Of the fact that she's different
 And yet she's the same
 And she says lucky you, lucky you
 
 She sings her little song, she walks along
 A little pathway headed for the skies
 Left to travels, lives they unravel
 Mind over matter, that's what she says
 
 Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
 A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
 Of the fact that she's different
 And yet she's the same
 And she says lucky you, lucky you, lucky you
 
 Maybe she'll sing you do do do do
 Maybe she'll bring you into the skies
 Honey she'll love you, funny how some view
 Angels above you ain't so far away
 
 Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
 A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
 Of the fact that she's different
 And yet she's the same
 And she says lucky you, lucky youYour feet under the table
 I love it when they're touching mine
 Your hands make the crisps at the cradle
 To tell me everything is fine
 All I see is you looking at me
 
 Do you know when you go
 You make the sweetest sight at the window
 If you had never come out of the blue
 I would have stayed up and Made Up You
 
 You smile just like a picture
 It doesn't even need a frame
 Sometimes I wait to answer
 Just to hear you say my name
 And all I want is just what I've got
 
 Do you know when you go 
 You make the sweetest sight at the window
 If you had never come out of the blue
 I would have stayed up and Made Up You
 
 I'd never let you go
 Even If I could
 Cause I never could've dreamed you up this good
 
 Oh oh
 
 Do you know when you go
 You make the sweetest sight at the window
 If you had never come out of the blue
 I would have stayed up and Made Up You
 
 Made Up You
 
 Oh oh
 
 Made Up YouHe's got a nice little life
 He's gonna live it, but on
 Friday nights he plays that mandolin
 Painted red, and he said
 It's not the best I know
 But it's mine, I'm gonna make it mine
 
 People there can't help but care
 About the friendly music of a guy
 Who's getting by from their applause
 He's got a song that moves along
 He's got his local crowd tonight
 At Angelina's family bar and grill
 
 He's got his heart on his sleeve
 The songs he plays just living free
 But who knows what goes through his mind
 When he plays a song it brings along
 Everybody saying
 Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
 Oh yeah, mandolin
 
 Got a car, got a scar
 Like everyone he's got a few but
 Everybody loves that mandolin
 Got his problems, bills to pay
 Somehow that boy finds a way
 Through paychecks in tip jars, yeah
 
 He's got his heart on his sleeve
 The songs he plays just living free
 But who knows what goes through his mind
 When he plays a song it brings along
 Everybody saying
 Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
 Oh yeah, mandolin
 
 Oh he's the kind of guy
 Who never really wanted fame
 His feet are planted firmly on the ground
 He never wanted people to remember his name
 He never wanted word to get around
 That he found heaven on earth
 
 He's got his heart on his sleeve
 The songs he plays just living free
 But who knows what goes through his mind
 When he plays a song it brings along
 Everybody saying
 Who's that guy who plays the mandolin
 Oh, I'm the guy who plays the mandolin
 Mandolin
 Oh, mandolinMe and Britney used to sit on the front porch drinking lemonade
 Talking about things no one else was ever supposed to hear
 In the summer shade
 She said she was gonna be a movie star
 And I said she was crazy
 Catching dreams and fireflies in a jar
 Just me and Britney
 
 Oh, oh
 We were babies, we were beautiful and free
 Oh, oh
 There was nothing that was out of reach
 For me and Britney
 
 She never made it to Hollywood but she made it to Memphis
 And this little old town just hasnt been the same since
 That boy she went ran off with, well I thought he was crazy
 Maybe I was just jealous that he'd come between me and Britney
 
 Oh, oh
 She was in love, she was beautiful and free
 Oh, oh
 She was always so much braver than me
 
 When the phone rang in the middle of the night
 Before she said a word I knew it was her
 She said Im sorry for waking you up but I didnt know who else to call
 Or where else to go
 
 Me and Britney sat down on the front porch
 Talking about love and how it changes things
 Changes people and it changes names and everything but me and Britney
 
 Oh, oh
 Were not as young, but were still beautiful and free
 Oh, oh
 Even when were old, were still gonna be
 
 Me and Britney sitting on the front porch drinking lemonade
 Talking about things no one else was ever gonna hear in the summer shadeI like glitter and sparkly dresses,
 But I'm not gonna talk about that
 In my monologue
 I like baking and things that smell like winter,
 But I'm not gonna talk about that
 In my monologue
 
 La la la, la la la
 
 I like writing songs about douche bags who cheat on me,
 But I'm not gonna say that
 In my monologue
 I like writing their names into songs so they're ashamed to go in public,
 But I'm not gonna say that
 In my monologue
 
 La la, la la la la la
 This is my musical monologue
 
 You might think I'd bring up Joe,
 The guy who broke up with me on the phone,
 But I'm not gonna mention him
 In my monologue
 Hey Joe! I'm doing real well,
 Tonight I'm hosting SNL
 But I'm not gonna brag about that
 In my monologue
 
 La la la, ha ha ha
 Ha ha ha, ha ha ha
 La la la
 
 And if you're wondering if I might,
 Be dating the werewolf from Twilight,
 (Hi Taylor!)
 I'm not gonna comment on that
 In my monologue
 
 La la, la la la la la
 This is my musical monologue
 
 You might be expecting me to say
 Something bad about Kanye
 And how he ran up on the stage
 And ruined my VMA monologue.....
 
 But there's nothing more to say
 Cause everything's okay
 I've got security lining this stage
 This is my SNL monologue
 
 La la, la la la la la
 This is my SNL monologue
 La la, la la la la la
 That was my SNL monologueI know we've got a lot to say
 Between now and forever
 But I'd be a game if you would play
 And my dear you get better
 
 All throughout the day
 You smile and walk away
 All I can think to do
 Is follow you
 
 If you leave I'll be crawling back for more
 if you need love I'll be standing at your door
 I'll be sick inside if baby you'd be my cure
 
 wherever you think I am tonight 
 just know we're miles from a heartbreak
 Because in the blink of a pretty brown eye 
 I'll be right where you are baby
 
 sometime along the way you take my breath away
 distracted by he view
 I fall right into you
 
 and if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
 and if you ever need love I'll be standing at your door
 I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure
 
 they say I need to see all the people out there waiting
 but you take one look at me
 and I know the mistake I'd be making
 
 cuz if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
 and if you ever need love I'm standing at your door
 I'll be sick inside if baby you be my cure
 
 I know we've got a lot to say between now and foreverSomething about me didn't fit into your perfect world
 I bet the bluegrass stained your smile
 You should use a darker color when you write on the wall
 I haven't read it a thousand times
 
 Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
 Honey I was trying so hard
 
 To talk, walk, think, stop
 Anytime you want me to
 Bend all my rules
 I used to let you choose
 Who you wanted me to be
 This time I'm flying free
 It's my turn to be me
 
 You liked the face but you had to replace me
 Inside I saw the walls of me go down
 You can take the girl away from
 Cowboy hats and steel guitars
 She'll still sing the same old songs
 
 Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
 Honey I was trying so hard
 
 To talk, walk, think, stop
 Anytime you want me to
 Bend all my rules
 I used to let you choose
 Who you wanted me to be
 This time I'm flying free
 It's my turn to be me
 
 Turned on that radio
 Hey that's when I realized
 It wasn't our song, it was yours
 And in conversation baby I was decoration
 Now I deserve a little bit more than
 
 To talk, walk, think, stop
 Anytime you want me to
 Bend all my rules
 I used to let you choose
 Who you wanted me to be
 This time I'm flying free
 It's my turn to be me
 
 It's my turn to be meOn a crowded highway
 Through a night alone
 I was barely breathing
 I was crawling home
 Well, it's quite not London
 Or the south of France
 Or an Asian Island
 Or a second chance
 
 Going back to Nashville
 Thinking 'bout the whole thing
 Guess you gotta run sometimes
 Maybe I'm a fast train
 Blowin' through a valley
 Watching all my life go by
 
 You're a distant memory
 You're an exit sign
 I was talking crazy
 On the drivers side
 And I know I hurt you
 But I can't confess
 Was that blood or a wine stain
 On your wedding dress
 
 Going back to Nashville
 Thinking 'bout the whole thing
 Guess you gotta run sometimes
 Maybe I'm a fast train
 Blowing through a mountain
 Watching all my life go by
 
 Going back to Nashville
 Laughing at a bad break
 What's the use of wondering why?
 Maybe I'm a storm front
 Blowing through a valley
 Tearing up a good July
 
 And its safe and warm
 Where nothing ever happens
 Could it be so hard
 To realign a star or two
 Change a southern night for you
 
 Going back to Nashville
 Thinking bout the whole thing
 Guess you gotta run sometimes
 Maybe I'm a fast train
 Blowing though a valley
 Tearing up a good July
 
 I'm going back to Nashville
 Laughing at a bad break
 What's the use of wondering why?
 Maybe I'm a storm front
 Blowing through the valley
 Tearing up a good July
 
 Going back to Nashville
 
 I'm going back to Nashville
 
 Going back to Naaaaahh....
 
 Going back to Nashville
 What's the use of wondering why?I need you now
 Read letters that I wrote on the wall
 And the message that I left when I called
 
 I need you now
 Words I said drowned out by the rain
 Waiting there for you but you never came
 
 My worlds a little colder now
 But Im keeping warm somehow
 
 So here you are at my window
 Guess nobody told you
 I dont need dont need you
 And I waited so frustrated
 Whos gonna hold you
 I dont need you dont need you now
 
 I need you now
 Words I heard you whisper to me
 We were walking down a one-way street
 
 You need me now
 Thats what youve been telling my friends
 That Ive come too far to go back there again
 
 My heart my mind and number have changed
 You might as well forget my name
 
 So here you are at my window
 Guess nobody told you
 I dont need you dont need you
 And I waited so frustrated
 Whos gonna hold you
 I dont need you dont need you now
 
 I need you now
 Red letters that I wrote on the wall
 And the message that I left when I called
 
 So here you are at my window
 Guess nobody told you
 I dont need you dont need you
 And I waited so frustrated
 So whos gonna hold you
 I dont need you now
 And I dont know where you are
 I dont wonder where you are
 I dont dream about you cause I dont need you now
 
 I dont dream about the way
 That I never heard you say
 I need you I need you
 I dont need you now
 
 Dont need you
 Dont need you nowI think you fell off of your cloud today
 You didn't see it coming or did you
 You tried to please everybody
 But the sweet breeze swept you away
 
 The sun goes down on a good day
 Tomorrow is still an unknown
 You think you're all alone in this place
 I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby
 
 Oh don't fade away baby
 Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
 Don't count the days as they leave you
 Count them as you find a day new
 Don't fade away
 Never fade
 
 Hard to breathe, nobody knows it's you
 Somebody blows your candle out
 You wore a mask, now that's broken too
 Everybody else was everything to you
 
 The sun goes down on a good day
 Tomorrow is still an unknown
 You think everybody wants a fight
 I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby
 
 Oh don't fade away baby
 Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
 Don't count the days as they leave you
 Count them as you find a day new
 Don't fade away
 Never fade
 
 I think you fell out of the sky today
 I think you know it's true
 You've seen the world, now all you see is me
 Tell me now baby what are you gonna do
 
 Oh don't fade away baby
 Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
 Don't count the days as they leave you
 Count them as you find a day new
 Don't fade away
 Don't fade away
 Don't fade away
 Never fadeLook at you
 Look at me
 Look at who we could be
 I wanna know who you are
 What you want from the stars
 And every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
 My head starts to spin and it hits me then
 I love you
 And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I don't
 Say it but I won't
 'Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you
 
 And all I really wanna do is be next to you
 But I'm too tired to fight
 And I could tell you now
 But baby, never mind
 
 All the time
 Everyday
 There's nothing I can do, baby, to make it go away
 So look at you
 And look at me
 And think of who we could be
 But every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
 My head starts to spin and it hits me then
 I love you
 And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I don't
 Say it but I won't
 'Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you
 
 And all I really wanna do is be next to you
 But I'm too tired to fight
 And I could tell you now
 But baby, never mind
 
 All I really wanna say is I need you, babe
 But how could you understand?
 What happens if you turn away and everything turns blue and grey?
 And I just wish I told you never mind
 And I could tell you now, but baby, never mind
 Yeah, oh yeah
 I could tell you now but never mind
 Yeah, oh yeah yeah
 And I could tell you now but never mindIt wasn't just like a movie
 The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
 I'm driving away and I, I guess you could say
 This is the last time I'll drive this way again
 When there's nothing to say and I try to grab at the fray
 Cause I, I still love you but I can't
 
 Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
 Bye, bye, baby
 I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
 And all you have is to walk away
 From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah
 
 The picture frame is empty
 It's black and white, you're smiling down at me
 I take your photo off the dash
 And back to the conversation
 I was so sure of everything we thought we'd always have
 I'm lost in the sound of it
 But here in the now comes in
 Seems like I'm becoming part of your past
 
 Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
 Bye, bye, baby
 I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
 And all you have is to walk away
 From the one thing I thought would never leave me
 
 And there's so much that I can't touch
 You're all I want but it's not enough this time
 And I can feel you like your slipping through my hands
 And I'm so scared of how this ends
 
 Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
 Bye, bye, baby
 I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
 And all you have is to walk away
 From the one thing I thought would never leave me
 
 Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
 Bye, bye, baby
 I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
 And all you have is to walk away
 From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah, yeah
 There was one thing I knew would never leave me
 
 It wasn't just like a movie
 The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skinStanding on the border
 Looking out into the great unknown
 I can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own
 There's a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind
 I'm heading out tonight, traveling light
 I'm gonna start all over again
 
 And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
 See how far I can go
 Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
 And talk to someone I don't know
 I will face the world around me
 Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
 And I will fall in love again
 Because I can
 
 Gonna climb the mountain
 And look the eagle in the eye
 I won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly
 How could I have ever believed
 That love had to be so blind
 When freedom was waiting, down at the station
 All I had to do was make up my mind
 
 And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
 See how far I can go
 Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
 And talk to someone I don't know
 I will face the world around me
 Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
 And I will fall in love again
 Because I can
 
 Well, I have walked through the fire
 And crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt
 Then the truth came shining like a light on me and now I can see my way out
 
 Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
 See how far I can go
 Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
 And talk to someone I don't know
 
 Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
 I'm gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne
 Gonna sail the ocean, gonna spread my wings
 Gonna climb that mountain, gonna do everythingOh
 We were standing in an empty room
 The moonlight was fallin'
 You were holdin' my hand when the car pulled up for you
 And I coulda spent a life with you
 But those days are over
 You were callin my name 
 When your face faded from view
 
 Wasn't it you that told me?
 The sun would always chase the day
 Wasn't it you that told me?
 
 Angels fly, in the air tonight
 Saying wasn't it just like swimmin" out on the lake?
 Stars collide in the air so light
 Or was it just like those promises that you made? On our last night
 
 Oh
 I remember waking up with you
 The days doin' nothin'
 You meant more to me then, than you ever knew
 You were gonna be a doctor, a movie star, poet at a nobel seminar
 Hope the the world never tore that out of you
 
 Wasn't it you that told me?
 The sun would always chase the day
 Wasn't it you that told me?
 
 Angels fly in the air tonight
 Saying wasn't it just like swimmin' out on the lake?
 And stars collide in the air so light
 Or was it just like those promises you made on Our last night?
 
 Tell me whatever happened to the things you loved?
 And the songs we played and the indian days
 Whatever happened to the things you gave away?
 Like harold and martin singing
 
 I was waving as you drove away
 The sunlight was falling
 You were riding backwards in a dusty window pane
 
 Angels fly in the air tonight
 Was it just like the promises that we made?
 And stars collide in the air so light
 Was it just like those promises that you made?
 On our last night
 On our last night 
 Oh,oh,oh,whoa,whoa,yeaah, ohI know he loved you
 A long time ago
 I ain't jealous of you
 Just thought you should know
 
 You were never good enough for him
 Or anything like me
 So you might as well sit back
 'cause I'm not trying to show maturity
 
 "X" is the shape I drew through your face
 In permanent marker
 Oh, yeah
 Just like the mark you knew you were making
 Who do you think you are?
 To write on his heart in
 Permanent marker
 
 I found that picture
 Of you in that green dress
 Sure had a good time
 Cleaning up that mess
 
 He found 30 other pieces
 But he'll never find them all
 Tried to tape it back together
 Now he knows to keep it off the wall
 
 "X" is the shape I drew through your face
 In permanent marker
 Oh, yeah
 Just like the mark you knew you were making
 Who do you think you are?
 To write on his heart in
 Permanent marker
 
 And I don't appreciate you calling him to reminisce
 The only reason is you're seeing how much better off he is
 
 "X" is the shape I drew through your face
 In permanent marker
 Oh, yeah
 Oh, yeah
 Just like the mark you knew you were making
 Who do you think you are?
 To write on his heart
 
 "X" is the shape I drew through your face
 In permanent marker
 Oh, yeah
 Just like the mark you knew you were making
 Who do you think you are?
 To write on his heart in
 Permanent marker
 
 In permanent marker
 
 Oh, permanent markerI could've keyed your car
 I could've rolled your yard
 I know the passwords to your emails, everything you do
 I could've put 'em to good use
 
 But I'm dressed to kill and tonight I'm going out on a date
 With your best friend, he always liked me anyway

 Baby, baby R-E-V-E-N-G-E
 Gonna give you what you gave to meI was scared of dentists and the dark
 I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
 Oh, all my friends are turning green
 You're the magician's assistant in their dreams
 
 Oh, and they come unstuck
 
 Lady, running down to the riptide
 Taken away to the dark side
 I wanna be your left hand man
 I love you when you're singing that song and
 I got a lump in my throat because
 You're gonna sing the words wrong
 
 There's this movie that I think you'll like
 This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
 This cowboy's running from himself
 And she's been living on the highest shelf
 
 Oh, and they come unstuck
 
 Lady, running down to the riptide
 Taken away to the dark side
 I wanna be your left hand man
 I love you when you're singing that song and
 I got a lump in my throat because
 You're gonna sing the words wrong
 
 I just wanna, I just wanna know
 If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
 I just gotta, I just gotta know
 I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
 I swear she's destined for the screen
 Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh
 
 Lady, running down to the riptide
 Taken away to the dark side
 I wanna be your left hand man
 I love you when you're singing that song and
 I got a lump in my throat because
 You're gonna sing the words wrong
 
 Oh lady, running down to the riptide
 Taken away to the dark side
 I wanna be your left hand man
 I love you when you're singing that song and
 I got a lump in my throat because
 You're gonna sing the words wrong
 
 Oh lady, running down to the riptide
 Taken away to the dark side
 I wanna be your left hand man
 I love you when you're singing that song and
 I got a lump in my throat because
 You're gonna sing the words wrong
 I got a lump in my throat because you're gonna sing the words wrongI remember your bare feet down the hallway
 I remember your little laugh
 Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
 I love you to the moon and back
 
 I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
 Like we had our own secret club
 I remember you dancing before bed time
 Then jumping on me, waking me up
 
 I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
 And even the moment I knew
 You fought it hard like an army guy
 Remember I leaned in and whispered to you
 
 Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
 You were my best four years
 
 I remember the drive home
 When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming "Why?"
 Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
 About a beautiful boy who died
 
 And it's about to be Halloween
 You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
 I remember the last day when I kissed your face
 And whispered in your ear
 
 Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
 Out of this curtained room in this hospital grey, we'll just disappear
 Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
 You were my best four years
 
 What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
 What if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
 And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
 What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?
 
 Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
 Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
 You were my best four years
 
 I remember your bare feet down the hallway
 I love you to the moon and backI remember tears streaming down your face
 When I said, "I'll never let you go"
 When all those shadows almost killed your light
 I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
 But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight
 
 Just close your eyes
 The sun is going down
 You'll be alright
 No one can hurt you now
 Come morning light
 You and I'll be safe and sound
 
 Don't you dare look out your window darling
 Everything's on fire
 The war outside our door keeps raging on
 Hold onto this lullaby
 Even when the music's gone
 Gone
 
 Just close your eyes
 The sun is going down
 You'll be alright
 No one can hurt you now
 Come morning light
 You and I'll be safe and sound
 
 Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh
 La La (La La)
 La La (La La)
 Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh
 La La (La La)
 
 Just close your eyes
 You'll be alright
 Come morning light,
 You and I'll be safe and sound...
 
 Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh oh ohLet's watch
 The tide chase
 The waves
 Onto the sand
 I wonder
 If a broken heart
 Feel the warmth
 On my hand
 And I wonder
 What a piece
 Of driftwood
 Has seen all through
 His lifetime
 Let's walk away
 The past through
 The smokey black nights
 
 I've seen
 A million things
 Spoke a million words
 Now I only want
 To speak to you
 
 Waiting for the words
 Counting every bird
 There's nothing
 I'd rather do
 On the
 Smokey black nights
 
 Still throught
 The haze
 I can make out
 Constellations
 I'll make one
 Of you and me
 As we sit
 In the sand
 And I saw
 That sunset gleamin
 As my eyes went wild
 Let's walk away
 The past through
 The smokey black nights
 
 I've played
 A thousand songs
 Sang a thousand words
 Now I only want
 To sing to you
 
 Waited on a wire
 Starin' at the fire
 There's nothing
 I'd rather do
 On the
 Smokey black nights
 
 I've walked
 A thousand miles
 Smiled
 A thousand smiles
 Now I only smile
 When I'm with you
 
 Waiting for the words
 Counting every bird
 There's nothing
 I'd rather do
 On the
 Smokey black nights
 
 So walk with me
 As the sweet
 Wind dances
 I'll write a song
 For you and me
 On the
 Smokey black nightsDays go by, I wonder if you here me
 Can't you read between the lines?
 Now I'm standing still, I am disappearing 
 Take this chance, I'll make you mine
 
 Don't you wonder why
 You change in time
 Makes you feel so empty inside
 
 But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
 I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
 And all I see is someone I don't know
 Love's got me tangled, tired me too
 No sign of a wall, sign of wall,
 Spinning me around
 And baby all I see is you
 
 He tells lies, are you really thinking
 That you deserve another try
 When you see these eyes
 You see another planet
 Don't ask how, but fate decides
 
 Don't you wonder why
 You change in time
 Makes you feel so empty inside
 
 But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
 I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
 And all I see is someone I don't know
 Love's got me tangled, tired me too
 No sign of a wall, sign of wall,
 Spinning me around
 And baby all I see is you
 
 Spinning and turning
 And living and learning
 I should be able to handle this
 Make it or break it
 Move it or shake it
 Do it or fake it
 Girl you've got to make it
 
 But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
 I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
 And all I see is someone I don't know
 Love's got me tangled, tired me too
 No sign of a wall, sign of wall,
 Spinning me around
 And baby all I see is you
 
 Spinning me around
 And baby all I see is you
 
 Spinning me around
 And all I see is youLet me know, how's it feel
 To be under my skin, wrapped around my heart
 Is it like anywhere you've been?
 And everything I do, I do it just for you
 So why the hell don't you love me?
 Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
 Are you so far above me?
 Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
 But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
 Stupid boy
 
 I have been looking in, trying to read your mind
 Give you the benefit of the doubt, every single time
 And then you walk right by, I'm screaming out inside
 Why the hell don't you love me?
 Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
 Are you so far above me?
 Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
 But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
 Stupid boy
 
 What happens when you wake up, to see that you've lost?
 You take one look at me, 'cause that's what it cost.
 I was gonna be everything you need
 'Cause you're everything to me
 
 So why the hell don't you love me?
 Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
 Are you so far above me?
 Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
 But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
 Stupid boy
 
 Let me know, how's it feel to be under my skinTire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze
 Whistle County creek
 Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass
 Baby, you were watching me
 Cold barn struck bed, everything you said
 Slowly educating me
 I never had a lesson so sweet
 
 You can get high on a first kiss
 You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
 You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
 Nothing's shatterproof
 You can crash and burn and come back someone new
 And that's what I learned from you
 
 Autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change
 Just like the two of us
 Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket
 Guess I loved you way too much
 But I'm a little smarter, my heart's a little harder
 But it's still soft enough to cry
 Cause I remember those times
 
 I remember.........
 
 You can get high on a first kiss
 You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
 You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
 Nothing's shatterproof
 You can crash and burn and come back someone new
 And that's what I learned from you
 
 Saw you just the other day
 All that I could think to say was,
 "Hey, how have you been?"
 You caught me with that old smile
 Said, "It's really been a while,
 And I still think about back when.."
 
 We used to get high on the first kiss
 We could get by with sweet tea and Jesus
 And you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
 Nothing's shatterproof
 You can crash and burn and now I'm someone new
 And that's what I learned from you
 
 Oh, that's what I learned from you
 That's what I learned from you, oh you, oh
 That's what I learned from you, oh yeahHit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
 Only sound, only sound that you hear is "No"
 You never saw it coming
 Slipped when you started running
 And now you've come undone and I, I, I, I
 
 Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh eh
 Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
 Wish I could make it better
 Someday you won't remember
 This pain you thought would last forever and ever
 
 There you'll stand, ten feet tall
 I will say, "I knew it all along."
 Your eyeswider than distance
 This lifesweeter than fiction
 
 Just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh oh
 All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
 They never saw it coming
 You hit the ground running
 And now you're onto something, I, I, I say
 
 What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
 Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
 And in this perfect weather
 It's like we don't remember
 The rain we thought would last forever and ever
 
 There you'll stand, ten feet tall
 I will say, "I knew it all along."
 Your eyeswider than distance
 This lifesweeter than fiction
 
 There you'll stand, next to me
 All at once, the rest is history
 Your eyeswider than distance
 This lifesweeter than fiction, fiction
 
 I'll be one of the many saying,
 "Look at you now, look at you now, now."
 I'll be one of the many saying,
 "You made us proud, you made us proud, proud."
 I'll be one of the many saying,
 "Look at you now, look at you now, now."
 I'll be one of the many saying,
 "You made us proud, you made us proud, proud."
 
 And when they call your name
 and they put your picture in a frame
 You know that I'll be there time and again
 'Cause I loved you when, when you
 
 Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
 Only sound, only sound that you heard was "No"
 Now in this perfect weather
 It's like we don't remember
 The rain we thought would last forever and ever (forever)
 
 There you'll stand, ten feet tall
 I will say, "I knew it all along."
 Your eyeswider than distance
 This lifesweeter than fiction
 
 There you'll stand next to me
 All at once, the rest is history
 Your eyeswider than distance
 This lifesweeter than fiction, fiction
 
 It's sweeter than fiction
 It's sweeter, yeah
 It's sweeter than, sweeter
 Sweeter than fictionIt was something like a perfect start to
 This love yesterday but now who are you
 I thought I knew
 Your eyes how to know to look right through me
 It's like you forgot the words you whispered to me
 They weren't true
 It's like it wasn't you
 
 Could you tell me what did I do
 Because it can't be we're already through
 Did you sell me out for a fool
 After you held me is that just what you do
 What did you need from me
 Tell me
 
 Take time to realize I know
 That people change their minds
 But that was something I wished you would say
 To my face
 But you run away
 
 Could you tell me what did I do
 Because it can't be we're already through
 Did you sell me out for a fool
 After you held me is that just what you do
 What did you need from me
 Tell me
 
 If I had a reason or a simple goodbye
 Baby even a lie
 Yeah Yeah
 
 Tell me what did I do
 Because baby suddenly we're already through
 Did you sell me out for a fool
 After you held me is that just what you do
 What did you need from me
 Tell me
 And tell me
 
 Ooooh Yeah
 Tell me
 Tell MeYou were what I wanted when I wanted what I just couldn't have
 You were country lovin' really somethin' for three months and a half
 
 Everybody said that you were bad news
 but baby I was betting on you
 
 So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
 Got myself a big country serving to pay back
 Now I'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
 But you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
 
 I said let them say we're crazy, you said let's go fishing a lot
 The midnight moon was blazing baby, I was gazing into your eyes
 
 Everything changed when you took me to town
 Caught you staring every other girl down
 
 So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
 Got myself a big country serving to pay back
 Now I'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
 But you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
 
 Can't believe the time you lost me
 Can't believe what it cost me
 
 Cause I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
 Got myself a big ol serving to pay back
 I had to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
 You ain't never been through that
 You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
 You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six packIm a laid back
 T-shirt, blue jean, mood ring
 Kinda girl
 Hey yeah whats the word on you
 Lay low Im a mission rebel
 Angel devil
 Little left of the middle
 Sometimes I get temperamental
 
 But here I am an open book
 Turn the page its all the rage
 Get a look on the inside
 Oh what you get is what you see
 Baby you hold the key
 To the diary of me
 
 Im poetry, complicated
 Simply stated
 Hey yeah baby how about you
 I was born free
 Im a cell phone hippie
 Are you with me?
 When I mess up I dont get up
 I just get down yeah
 
 But here I am an open book
 Turn the page its all the rage
 Get a look on the inside
 Oh what you get is what you see
 Baby you hold the key
 To the diary of me
 
 Its raining on Sunday
 Theres nothing on TV
 Yesterday was lonely
 Youre the only one who gets me
 My mind is like an island
 Drifting through the ocean
 I cant stop thinking about you
 I bet youre thinking of me too
 
 Well here I am an open book
 Turn the page its all the rage
 Get a look on the inside
 Oh what you get is what you see
 Baby you hold the key
 To the diary of me
 Yeah here I am an open book
 Turn the page its all the rage
 Get a look on the inside
 Oh what you get is what you see
 Baby you hold the key
 To the diary of meShould have been different but
 It wasn't different, was it
 Same old story, dear john, 
 And so long
 Should have fit like a glove
 Should have fit like a ring
 Like a diamond ring
 A token of true love
 Should have all worked out
 But it didn't
 She should be here now
 But she isn't
 
 [Chorus:]
 There's your trouble, 
 There's your trouble
 You keep seeing double
 With the wrong one
 You can't see I love you, 
 You can't see she doesn't
 But you just keep holding on
 There's your trouble
 
 So now you're thinking 'bout
 All you're missing how
 Deep you're sinking, 
 Round and round and dragging down
 Why don't you cash in your chips
 Why don't you call it a loss
 Not such a big loss, 
 Chalk it up better luck
 Could have been true love
 But it wasn't
 It should all add up
 But it doesn't
 
 [Repeat chorus]
 
 Should have all worked out
 But it didn't
 She should be here now
 But she isn't
 
 [Repeat chorus]Stumble up the porch step
 You sat down in the car
 Only thirteen blocks across this town
 To get to where you are
 And that dont offer me much time
 To make up my mind
 So I best be driving slow
 On my way to letting go
 
 These headlights they just wanna fade
 Off into the night
 But if theyre half as stubborn as me
 Theyll just keep on shining bright
 I aint ever been one to settle like
 The dust does on the dash
 Since the feeling aint strong
 Ill just move on
 And leave this in my past
 
 Once you're gone I know your memory'll
 Somehow get the best of me
 So I question everything I do
 Unsure of turning you away
 Wondering love how Ill act today
 Until you find somebody new
 So Ive been holding on
 Way too long
 But not another minute
 I'm gonna miss you bad but
 Cant call it love if you aint in it
 
 Red light turns to green
 Then back to red again
 I wish there were some other travelers out here
 To slow my travelling
 Even though the wheel rolled on
 Inside I still dont know
 Oh and it troubles me so
 
 Once you're gone I know your memory'll
 Somehow get the best of me
 So I question everything I do
 Unsure of turning you away
 Wondering love how Ill feel today
 I see you found somebody new
 And Ive been holding on
 Way too long
 But not another minute
 I might miss you bad but
 Cant call it love if you aint in it
 
 Once you're gone I know your memory'll
 Somehow get the best of me
 So I question everything I do
 Unsure of turning you away
 Wondering love how Ill feel today
 I see you found somebody new
 So Ive been holding on
 Way too long
 But not another minute
 I might miss you bad but
 Cant call it love if you aint in it
 
 Your car comes to a rest in the drive
 You open up the door and I see you smileWalking downtown shuffling my feet
 I try to dream my dreams above the concrete
 Store windows, traveled for miles
 But something I passed really caught my eye
 It was cracked down the middle, permanent scars
 But I fell in love with this here guitar
 
 Nice to meet you, can I teach you
 All I know, can you show me what you do
 Where have you been
 What have you seen
 Who were you before you even knew me
 Have you been played for endless hours
 Or were you left in the corner
 Or were you someone's best friend
 This here guitar
 
 It was my baby, anyone could see
 I love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty
 But I can't help wondering why
 It came to me and where we'll say goodbye
 The cracks down the middle
 Can't see where they are
 Since I fell in love with this here guitar
 
 Nice to meet you, can I teach you
 All I know, can you show me what you do
 Where have you been
 What have you seen
 Who were you before you even knew me
 Have you been played for endless hours
 Or were you left in the corner
 Or were you someone's best friend
 This here guitar
 
 Were you a present from a father to a son
 Did he forget you 
 Or just play you 'til you came undone
 Hey did some prima donna love you 
 'Til she got her fame and fortune
 I won't do that to you
 
 Nice to meet you, I can teach you
 All I know, you can show me what you do
 Where have you been
 What have you seen
 Who were you before you even knew me
 And I played you for endless hours
 Never left you in the corner
 You're my one and only friend
 Now I know where life lessons are
 This here guitar
 
 You're my guitar
 
 This here guitarBeneath the chandelier of stars and atmosphere
 Tangled like the roots on the ground
 The windows opened up
 The wind is blowing and we're both not making a sound
 Its like Im melting on into you
 Give me a reason why we should ever move
 and
 
 Tell me
 Youll never leave me
 and Im not crazy and
 This is really happening
 That this is really happening
 
 Could this be better?
 You write me letters
 So you see me everyday
 You tend to treat me like
 My name is up in lights
 It really blows me away
 
 Lock me up in a dark room
 And I still cant take my eyes off you
 
 Tell me
 Youll never leave me
 and Im not crazy and
 This is really happening
 That this is really happening
 
 All those kisses up against your car
 For all those wishes on planes
 We thought were stars
 Memories like photographs
 Oh Baby,Here we are
 
 Tell me
 Youll never leave me
 and Im not crazy and
 Oh,This is really happening
 Oh,Oh,Baby
 
 Tell me
 Youll always need me
 That I drive you crazy
 And this is really happening
 Oh,that this is really happening
 
 Tell me,Oh
 Youll always need me
 (need me,tell me)
 (Baby)
 That I drive you crazy
 (Oh)
 That this is really happening[T-Pain:]

 [T-Pain & Taylor:]

 [Taylor Swift:]
 I had high top Nikes

 [T-Pain & Taylor:]
 Diamonds in my mouth 
 And Diamonds on my mic
 
 [Taylor Swift:]
 By the time I woke I was singing

 [Taylor Swift (T-Pain):]
 What, What, I knit sweaters, yo!
 What, What, Don't test me (Beep)
 Hey, Hold on, hold on
 I didn't even say anything I- (What?)
 I said Yo (yup)
 You guys bleeped me and I didn't even say anything
 I didn't swear (She didn't even swear)
 Hello? Ugh!Do you remember the day
 I leaned up against your car
 And it started rolling down the street
 You screamed and ran after it
 And tried to open the door
 And it ran over your foot
 And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see.
 
 It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
 It takes five seconds to need you
 When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
 'Cause they don't know to play our song
 I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
 I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
 'Cause that's where you belong
 Until Brad Pitt comes along
 
 Do you remember the time we watched Carrie
 And you said it reminded you of me
 And I threw the remote at you
 And you said "my point exactly"
 And later on that night, under the neon city lights,
 You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me.
 
 It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
 It takes five seconds to need you
 
 When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
 'Cause they don't know to play our song
 I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
 I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
 'Cause that's where you belong
 Until Brad Pitt comes along
 
 You call me lucky 'cause I lose everything
 But I swear I'd be careful with it
 If you gave me a ring
 
 And it would take Brad Pitt to leave you
 It takes five seconds to need you
 When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
 'Cause they don't play our song
 I wish that pretty girls wouldn't see you
 I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
 'Cause that's where you belong
 Until Brad Pitt comes along
 'Til Brad Pitt comes along
 Yeah, oh oh
 Until Brad Pitt comes alongToday was a fairytale
 You were the prince
 I used to be a damsel in distress
 You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
 Today was a fairytale
 
 Today was a fairytale
 
 Today was a fairytale
 I wore a dress
 You wore a dark grey t-shirt
 You told me I was pretty
 When I looked like a mess
 Today was a fairytale
 
 Time slows down
 Whenever you're around
 
 Can you feel this magic in the air?
 It must have been the way you kissed me
 Fell in love when I saw you standing there
 It must have been the way
 Today was a fairytale
 
 It must have been the way
 Today was a fairytale
 
 Today was a fairytale
 You've got a smile that takes me to another planet
 Every move you make everything you say is right
 Today was a fairytale
 
 Today was a fairytale
 All that I can say
 Is now it's getting so much clearer
 Nothing made sense until the time I saw your face
 Today was a fairytale
 
 Time slows down
 Whenever you're around
 Yeah yeah
 
 But can you feel this magic in the air?
 It must have been the way you kissed me
 Fell in love when I saw you standing there
 It must have been the way
 Today was a fairytale
 It must have been the way
 Today was a fairytale
 
 [Instrumental]
 
 Time slows down
 Whenever you're around
 I can feel my heart
 It's beating in my chest
 Did you feel it?
 I can't put this down
 
 But can you feel this magic in the air?
 It must have been the way you kissed me
 Fell in love when I saw you standing there
 It must have been the way
 
 But can you feel this magic in the air?
 It must have been the way you kissed me
 Fell in love when I saw you standing there
 It must have been the way
 Today was a fairytale
 It must have been the way
 Today was a fairytale
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, oh, oh
 
 Today was a fairytaleAre you trying to make me fall
 'Cause with a face like that baby
 It won't take too long
 Keep on melting me with those eyes
 And I think in a while I'll be hypnotized
 Sitting here singing
 
 Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
 Ooh, ooh, come a little closer
 Oh, oh, I love you I love you
 And I'm down to my last breath
 Trying to get my heels back under my head
 
 Baby somewhere around the time
 The moment I saw you
 With your hair all sticking up 
 I was all caught up
 'Cause baby you were so damn cute
 I need you to need me 
 See the train is coming for me
 Help me, save me from this crash at last
 
 Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
 Ooh, ooh, come a little closer
 Oh, oh, I love you I love you
 And I'm down to my last breath
 Trying to get my heels back under my head
 
 Na na na na na na na na na 
 You seem to be just what I've tried to find
 And your name looks so good written next to mine
 Next to mine
 Next to mine
 
 Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
 Ooh, ooh I really really want you
 Oh, oh I love you I love you
 Oh, oh.. 
 
 Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
 Ooh, ooh, come a little closer
 Oh, oh, I love you I love you
 And I'm down to my last breath
 Trying to get my heels back under my headI used to rule the world
 Seas would rise when I gave the word
 Now in the morning I sleep alone
 Sweep the streets I used to own
 
 I used to roll the dice
 Feel the fear in my enemys eyes
 Listen as the crowd would sing
 Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!
 
 One minute I held the keys
 Next the doors were closed on me
 And I discovered that my castles stand
 Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand
 
 I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
 Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
 Be my mirror, my sword and shield
 My missionaries in a foreign field
 
 For some reason I cant explain
 Once you go there was never
 Never an honest word
 But that was when I ruled the world
 
 It was a wicked and wild wind
 Blew down the doors to let me in
 Shattered windows and the sound of drums
 People couldnt believe what Id become
 
 Revolutionaries wait
 For my head on a silver plate
 Just a puppet on a lonely string
 Oh who would ever wanna be king?
 
 I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
 Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
 Be my mirror, my sword and shield
 My missionaries in a foreign field
 
 For some reason I cant explain
 I know Saint Peter wont call my name
 Never an honest word
 But that was when I ruled the world
 
 For some reason I cant explain
 I know Saint Peter wont call my name
 Never an honest word
 But that was when I ruled the worldIf you had only gotten to me first
 If I could write a book on how this hurts
 If you could see the way your smile looks to me
 
 If I wasn't scared of the world alone
 If I didn't know he loves me so
 If I could only find the strength to leave
 You'd be with me, so baby
 
 Don't you look in my eyes
 I might fall in love
 With a beautiful boy
 I wish that I could touch
 You go I hope you think of me
 
 As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
 This girl is begging wait for me
 
 It's so wrong that all I wanna do
 Is forget it all and just be with you
 I have to go 'cause he don't know
 But the writing's on the wall
 
 But here we are in so deep
 Soaking wet
 Jumping in without no safety net
 And I don't know what kinda ropes
 Would break this kinda fall, so baby
 
 Don't you look in my eyes
 I might fall in love
 With a beautiful boy
 I wish that I could touch
 You go, I hope you think of me
 
 As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
 This girl is begging wait, wait for me
 
 We can't be together right now
 Guess there's no use in trying
 But if you look at me right now
 Can you tell that I'm dying
 To hold you
 But it would be wrong to
 
 So don't you look in my eyes
 I might fall in love
 With a beautiful boy
 I wish that I could touch
 You go I hope you think of me
 As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
 This girl is begging wait for me
 
 Don't you look now
 Don't you look now
 I might fall in love
 Don't you look nowWe used to walk along the street
 When the porch lights were shining bright
 Before I had somewhere to be
 Back when we had all night
 And we were happy
 
 I do recall a good while back
 We snuck into the circus
 You threw your arms around my neck
 Back when I deserved it
 And we were happy
 
 When it was good baby,
 It was good baby
 We showed 'um all up
 No one could touch the way we
 Laughed in the dark
 Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
 We were gonna buy someday
 And we were happy
 
 We used to watch the sun go down
 On the boats in the water
 That's sorta how I feel right now
 And Goodbye's so much harder
 'Cause we were happy
 
 When it was good baby,
 It was good baby
 We showed 'um all up
 No one could touch the way we
 Laughed in the dark
 Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
 We were gonna buy someday
 And we were happy
 
 Oh, I hate those voices
 Telling me I'm not in love anymore
 But they don't give me choices
 And that's what these tears are for
 'Cause we were happy
 
 We Were Happy
 
 When it was good baby,
 It was good baby
 We showed 'um all up
 No one could touch the way we
 Laughed in the dark
 Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
 And you were gonna marry me
 When we were happy
 
 Yeah, We were were happy
 Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
 We Were happyI got a little thing I call self control
 'Cause I get a little crazy 
 When I let too much go
 Loves a little messy and you are too
 Right now Im scared of both of you
 I laugh and I play and I wasnt gonna stray 
 Swore Id never let a man in my way
 
 Youre the last thing I needed today
 
 And I dont know 
 Where I lost control
 And couldnt take it any longer
 Must have been somewhere between 
 Your smile and the way you say my name
 I cant win so I give in 
 The more I fight it just gets stronger
 Youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
 Welcome distraction, welcome distraction
 
 Gone and spilled my coffee 
 Tryna get to the phone
 'Cause it might be you
 You just never know
 Cant talk to my friends 
 Without you coming up
 Its even kind of cute 
 The way you cuss
 I wrote your name down 
 A hundred thousand times
 'Cause it looks so good 
 Right next to mine
 
 Youre the last thing I needed tonight
 
 And I dont know 
 Where I lost control
 And couldnt take it any longer
 Must have been somewhere between 
 Your smile and the way you say my name
 I cant win so I give in 
 The more I fight it just gets stronger
 Youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
 Welcome distraction
 
 Im acting like a girl 
 With nothing to lose
 When did I stop caring 
 About anything but you
 
 And I dont know 
 Where I lost control
 And couldnt take it any longer
 Must have been somewhere between 
 Your smile and the way you say my name
 I cant win so I give in 
 The more I fight it just gets stronger
 Youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
 
 Welcome distraction, welcome distraction
 Welcome distraction, welcome distraction oh ohWhat do you say, when you just know
 That he's the one, and you wanna go fast
 But he's taking it slow
 And what do you do, when he's next to you
 But he's a little bit shy
 Well here's something you can try
 
 Hey, hey what do you say
 We go walking down the river all together
 It's a warm May beautiful day
 And I feel like I could
 Talk to you forever
 With the sun shining bright
 It feels just like a day
 When everything's gonna go just right
 I know it will be a sweet memory
 For you and me someday
 What do you say?
 
 What do you see, when you look in his eyes
 There's something there
 That he can't disguise
 No matter how he tries
 And what do you feel, when you know its real
 And you can't sit still
 If you don't own up will yeah
 
 Hey, hey what do you say
 We go walking down the river all together
 It's a warm May beautiful day
 And I feel like I could
 Talk to you forever
 With the sun shining bright
 It feels just like a day
 When everything's gonna go just right
 I know it will be a sweet memory
 For you and me someday
 What do you say?
 
 My imagination's running away
 Just dreaming about
 What I want you to say
 
 Hey, hey what do you say
 We go walking down the river all together
 It's a warm May beautiful day
 And I feel like I could
 Talk to you forever
 With the sun shining bright
 It feels just like a day
 When everything's gonna go just right
 I know it will be a sweet memory
 For you and me someday
 
 What do you say?
 What do you say?
 
 What do you say?
 What do you say?She's looking in the mirror
 The moment's getting nearer
 She thinks about it as she walks her walk
 Up and down the staircase
 Make up fresh on her face
 She thinks about it as she talks her talk
 
 School dance, first chance
 Always been a dreamer
 There's one guy, she's shy
 Sees him through the mirror
 And everybody looks at her
 She thinks about it
 
 Blue dress, angel face
 Looking in the mirror
 Shoes, purse, hair tied back
 And you should see her
 She's got her magic
 Floating through the air
 
 Peace, love
 One thing leads into another
 Dream big, aim small
 Man you gotta love her
 She's got her hopes up
 Got 'em up to there
 Wondering what to wear
 
 She's standing in her bedroom
 He'll be pulling up soon
 She thinks about it when she sees headlights
 Looking out the window
 She's got her diary to show
 That she's been waiting for this all her life
 
 First date, can't wait
 Looking in the mirror
 Heart all wrapped up
 Wait until he sees her
 He's looking right at her
 She thinks about it
 
 Sixteen blue jeans, Abercrombie T-shirt
 Shoes, purse, hair tied back
 And you should see her
 She's got her magic
 Floating through the air
 
 Peace, love
 One thing leads into another
 Dream big, aim small
 Man you gotta love her
 She's got her hopes up
 Got 'em up to there
 Wondering what to wear
 
 The years went by
 The mirror saw her cry
 She got up again
 She got up again
 The wind blew by
 The small town lights
 She got up again
 
 Move out, find out
 Where the world can take her
 Bright lights, late nights
 Living for the greater
 Move to Paris
 Living on a prayer
 
 Peace, love
 One thing leads into another
 Dream big, aim small
 Man you gotta love her
 She's got her hopes up
 Got 'em up to there
 She's got her hopes up
 Got 'em up to there
 Wondering what to wear
 
 Ohh, oh, oh
 Wondering what to wearYou walk in here with your guitar man
 Your shining boots and your full on band
 A smile on your face, a knife in your hand
 Singing songs you've got memorized
 With whatever talent money buys
 So polished that it slips right through your hands
 
 But don't ruin yourself I ain't your competition
 Don't flatter yourself that was never my intention
 
 I wanna talk about what you are that I ain't
 Let's talk about what you do that I can't
 Let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
 Let's talk about what you did to get here
 Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
 Let's talk about what you want to be and who I've always been
 
 I walk in here with a beat up case
 The same guitar I've always played
 And the words i wrote down on a page,
 When i was 12 years old a small town raised
 You tell the crowd you're paying dues,
 I tell them, "this is what I do"
 And its what i put my life into,
 As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume
 
 And say life on musical road is rough conditions
 But the easy ride was never my ambition
 
 I wanna talk about what you are that I ain't
 Let's talk about what you do that I can't
 Let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
 Let's talk about what you did to get here
 Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
 Let's talk about what you want to be and who I've always been
 
 Let's talk about your childhood days
 You were the prom queen, I was on this stage
 So where's that crown gotten you these days?
 When it's me and you and the same damn games
 
 So what have you got that I ain't?
 And what can you do that I can't?
 Let's put me and you in an empty room and see who wins
 Let's talk about what you did to get here
 Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
 Let's talk about what you wanna be, girl, and who I've always beenI can't believe you did it again
 Walked by and took my heart with you
 Why did you have to look so good?
 Don't you know that I'm trying to hate you
 Trying to have a dream without you in it
 But how can I put out this fire
 When you're the one who lit it
 
 I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
 That I'm really ok when I'm not
 I want to know how it feels to be 
 Over you for real 
 Until I do
 I'll keep writing songs about you
 
 I've got a stack of papers so high
 And it's all about you baby
 Keep thinking maybe I
 Can make sense of something crazy
 Something I can't get out of my Head
 I write your name I write your name
 Then I tear it all to shreds
 
 I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
 That I'm really ok when I'm not
 I want to know how it feels to be 
 Over you for real 
 Until I do
 I'll keep writing songs about you
 
 And if you ever change your mind 
 And want me back again
 I hope these songs will remind me
 Why I shouldn't let you in
 
 I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
 That I'm really ok cause I'm not
 I want to know how it feels to be 
 Over you for real 
 Until I do
 
 I'll just wait for the day
 I stop pretending
 That I'm really ok when I'm not
 I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
 Till I do, 
 I'll keep writing songs about youI bet you lie awake at night
 Trying to make up your sweet mind
 Wondering if you'll ever find
 Just what you want
 A home-town number one
 Or a California loaded gun
 But you know you only get one
 Or that's what you thought
 But here's what you've got
 
 [Chorus:]
 I could be your favorite blue jeans
 With the holes in the knees
 In the bottom of the top drawer
 I could be your little beauty queen
 Just a little outta reach
 Or the girl living next door
 I'll be your angel giving up her wings
 If that's what you need
 I'd give everything to be your anything
 
 If you want hard to get
 If you want...
 All you have to do is let me know
 If you want a bumpy ride
 Or someone with a softer side
 Either one'll be alright
 Just let me know
 Cause this is where it goes
 
 [Chorus]
 
 It's not like I'm giving up who I am for you
 but for someone like you it's just so easy to do
 
 I could be your favorite blue jeans
 With the holes in the knees
 In the bottom of the top drawer
 I could be your little beauty queen
 Just a little outta reach
 Or the girl living next door
 I'll be your angel giving up her wings
 If that's what you need
 
 If that's what you need
 
 [Chorus]I heard a song tonight on the radio
 Another girl sings about a boy
 Just sees his face in every space in every room
 And i know that if i turn around you won't be there
 If i close my eyes will you be there?
 
 I don't wanna lose your face
 And i don't wanna wake one day
 And not remember what time erased
 And i don't wanna turn around
 Coz i'm not scared
 Of what love gave me and took away
 And i don't wanna lose your face
 
 I've got a picture of you in my bedroom
 And i hope it never falls
 And i hope i never lose that feeling
 I used to get when you would call
 And now i wonder to myself
 Who were you and where are you?
 Were you ever here at all?
 
 I don't wanna lose your face
 And i don't wanna wake one day
 And not remember what time erased
 And i don't wanna turn around
 Coz i'm not scared
 Of what love gave me and took away
 And i don't wanna lose your face
 
 That girl in the song had it so good
 I wish i could close my eyes and see you
 I wish the sky had your face
 And the oceans had your eyes
 And the sunset had your lips
 And i had you
 
 I don't wanna lose your face
 And i don't wanna wake one day
 And not remember what time erased
 And i don't wanna turn around
 Coz i'm not scared
 Of what love gave me and took away
 And i don't wanna lose your face

 Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,3,The first time you ever saw me cry,35,2010
 Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,3,Maybe this is wishful thinking,36,2010
