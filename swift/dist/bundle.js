be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on\n Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world\n \n Got the radio on, my old blue jeans\n And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve\n Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine\n Could you tell me what more do I need\n And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah\n But that's ok\n \n [Chorus]\n \n Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission\n But I'm ready to fly\n \n I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know\n I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on\n Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know\n Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world\n \n Oh I'm just a girl\n Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh,\n Oh I'm just a girlYou have a way of coming easily to me\n And when you take, you take the very best of me\n So I start a fight cause I need to feel something\n And you do what you want cause I'm not what you wanted\n \n [Chorus:]\n \n Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day\n Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say\n And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through\n I've never been anywhere cold as you\n \n You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray\n And I stood there loving you and wished them all away\n And you come away with a great little story\n Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you\n \n [Repeat Chorus]\n \n You never did give a damn thing honey but I cried, cried for you\n And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you\n (Died for you)\n \n Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day\n Every smile you fake is so condescending\n Counting all the scars you made\n And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through\n I've never been anywhere cold as youI didn't know what I would find\n When I went looking for a reason, I know\n I didn't read between the lines\n And, baby, I've got nowhere to go\n I tried to take the road less traveled by\n But nothing seems to work the first few times\n Am I right?\n \n [Chorus:]\n \n So how can I ever try to be better?\n Nobody ever lets me in\n I can still see you, this ain't the best view\n On the outside looking in\n I've been a lot of lonely places\n I've never been on the outside\n \n You saw me there, but never knew\n I would give it all up to be\n A part of this, a part of you\n And now it's all too late so you see\n You could've helped if you had wanted to\n But no one notices until it's too\n Late to do anything\n \n [Repeat Chorus]\n \n So how can I ever try to be better?\n Nobody ever lets me in\n I can still see you, this ain't the best view\n On the outside looking in\n I've been a lot of lonely places\n I've never been on the outsideSeems the only one who doesn't see your beauty\n Is the face in the mirror looking back at you\n You walk around here thinking you're not pretty\n But that's not true, cause I know you...\n \n [Chorus:]\n Hold on, baby, you're losing it\n The water's high, you're jumping into it\n And letting go... and no one knows\n That you cry, but you don't tell anyone\n That you might not be the golden one\n And you're tied together with a smile\n But you're coming undone\n \n I guess it's true that love was all you wanted\n Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change\n Hoping it will end up in his pocket\n But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain\n Oh, cause it's not his price to pay\n Not his price to pay...\n \n [Chorus x2]\n \n You're tied together with a smile\n But you're coming undone... oh\n Goodbye, baby\n With a smile, baby, babyCory's eyes are like a jungle\n He smiles, it's like the radio\n He whispers songs into my window\n In words that nobody knows\n There's pretty girls on every corner\n That watch him as he's walking home\n Saying, \"Does he know?\"\n Will you ever know?\n \n [Chorus:]\n You're beautiful\n Every little piece love,\n And don't you know\n You're really gonna be someone,\n Ask anyone.\n And when you find everything you looked for\n I hope your life lead you back to my door\n Oh, but if it don't,\n Stay beautiful\n \n Cory finds another way to be\n The highlight of my day\n I'm taking pictures in my mind\n So I can save them for a rainy day\n It's hard to make a conversation\n When he's taking my breath away\n I should say, hey, by the way...\n \n [Chorus]\n \n If you and I are a story\n That never gets told\n If what you are is a daydream\n I'll never get to hold,\n At least you'll know...\n \n You're beautiful\n Every little piece love,\n And don't you know\n You're really gonna be someone,\n Ask anyone.\n And when you find everything you looked for,\n I hope your life lead you back to my front door.\n Oh, but if it don't\n Will you stay\n Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful\n Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful\n La la la\n Oh, oh, oh, oh,\n Oh, but if it don't,\n Stay beautiful\n Stay beautiful\n Na, na, na, na, naIt's strange to think the songs we used to sing\n The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone\n Yesterday I found out about you\n Even now just looking at you feels wrong\n \n You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance\n It was a moment of weakness and you said, \"Yes.\"\n \n [Chorus:]\n You should've said \"No\", you should've gone home\n You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go\n You should've known that word, with what you did with her,\n Get back to me (get back to me).\n And I should've been there in the back of your mind\n I shouldn't be asking myself, \"Why?\"\n You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...\n You should've said \"No\", baby, and you might still have me\n \n You can see that I've been crying\n Baby, you know all the right things to say\n But do you honestly expect me to believe\n We could ever be the same?\n \n You say that the past is the past, you need one chance\n It was a moment of weakness and you said, \"Yes.\"\n \n [Chorus]\n \n I can't resist\n Before you go, tell me this:\n Was it worth it?\n Was she worth this?\n \n No... no, no, no...\n \n [Chorus]She said, I was seven and you were nine\n I looked at you like the stars that shined\n In the sky, the pretty lights\n And our daddies used to joke about the two of us\n Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled\n And rolled their eyes and said oh my my my\n \n Take me back to the house in the backyard tree\n Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me\n You never did, you never did\n Take me back when our world was one block wide\n I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried\n Just two kids, you and I...\n Oh my my my my\n \n Well, I was sixteen when suddenly\n I wasn't that little girl you used to see\n But your eyes still shined like pretty lights\n And our daddies used to joke about the two of us\n They never believed we'd really fall in love\n And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes\n And said oh my my my...\n \n Take me back to the creek beds we turned up\n Two A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me\n Take me back to the time we had our very first fight\n The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight\n You stayed outside till the morning light\n Oh my my my my\n \n A few years had gone and come around\n We were sitting at our favorite spot in town\n And you looked at me, got down on one knee\n \n Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle\n Our whole town came and our mamas cried\n You said I do and I did too\n Take me home where we met so many years before\n We'll rock our babies on that very front porch\n After all this time, you and I\n \n I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine\n I'll still look at you like the stars that shine\n In the sky, oh my my my...I was riding shotgun\n With my hair undone\n In the front seat of his car\n He's got a one-hand feel\n On the steering wheel\n The other on my heart\n I look around, turn the radio down\n He says, \"Baby is something wrong?\"\n I say, \"Nothing,\n I was just thinking\n How we don't have a song\"\n And he says...\n \n [Chorus:]\n Our song is the slamming screen door,\n Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window\n When we're on the phone and you talk real slow\n 'cause it's late and your mama don't know\n Our song is the way you laugh\n The first date: \"Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have\"\n And when I got home ... 'fore I said amen\n Asking God if he could play it again\n \n I was walking up\n The front porch steps\n After everything that day\n Had gone all wrong\n And been trampled on\n And lost and thrown away\n Got to the hallway,\n Well on my way\n To my lovin' bed\n I almost didn't notice\n All the roses\n And the note that said...\n \n [Chorus:]\n Our song is the slamming screen door,\n Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window\n When we're on the phone and you talk real slow\n 'cause it's late and your mama don't know\n Our song is the way you laugh\n The first date: \"Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have\"\n And when I got home ... 'fore I said amen\n Asking God if he could play it again\n \n I've heard every album, listened to the radio\n Waited for something to come along\n That was as good as our song...\n \n [Chorus:]\n 'Cause our song is the slamming screen door,\n Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window\n When we're on the phone and he talks real slow\n 'cause it's late and his mama don't know\n Our song is the way he laughs\n The first date: \"Man, I didn't kiss him, when I should have\"\n And when I got home ... 'fore I said amen\n Asking God if he could play it again\n Play it again\n \n Oh, yeah...\n Oh-oh, yeah.\n \n I was riding shotgun\n With my hair undone\n In the front seat of his car\n I grabbed a pen\n And an old napkin\n And I wrote down our songFriday night beneath the stars,\n in a field behind your yard,\n you and I are paintin' pictures in the sky.\n And sometimes we don't say a thing;\n just listen to the crickets sing.\n Everything I need is right here by my side.\n And I know everything about you\n I don't wanna live without you.\n \n [Chorus:]\n I'm only up when you're not down.\n Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.\n It's like no matter what I do.\n Well you drive me crazy half the time;\n the other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true.\n And I'm only me when I'm with you.\n \n Just a small town boy and girl\n livin' in a crazy world.\n Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true.\n And I don't try to hide my tears.\n The secrets or my deepest fears.\n Through it all nobody gets me like you do.\n And you know everything about me.\n You say that you can't live without me.\n \n [Chorus]\n \n When I'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself.\n Only you can tell.\n \n [Chorus:]\n That I'm only up when you're not down.\n Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.\n It's like no matter what I do.\n Well you drive me crazy half the time;\n the other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true.\n And I'm only me\n Who I wanna be\n Well, I'm only me when I'm with you\n With you\n Uh huh\n YeahShe cant see the way your eyes\n Light up when you smile.\n Shell never notice how you stop and stare\n Whenever she walks by.\n \n And you cant see me wantin' you the way you want her\n But you are everything to me.\n \n [Chorus:]\n I just wanna show you\n She dont even know you,\n She's never gonna love you like I want to.\n And you just see right through me.\n If you only knew me\n We could be a beautiful\n Miracle,\n Unbelievable\n Instead of just invisible.\n \n Theres a fire inside of you\n That cant help but shine through.\n Shes never gonna see the light\n No matter what you do.\n \n And all I think about is how to make you think of me\n And everything that we could be\n \n [Chorus]\n \n Like shadows in a faded light\n Oh, were invisible.\n I just wanna open your eyes\n And make you realize.\n \n I just wanna show you\n She dont even know you.\n Baby, let me love you,\n Let me want you.\n You just see right through me\n But if you only knew me\n We could be a beautiful\n Miracle,\n Unbelievable\n Instead of just invisible.\n \n She cant see the way your eyes\n Light up when you smile.[Chorus 1:]\n Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?\n Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?\n Why would you wanna make the very first scar?\n Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?\n \n Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall.\n And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall.\n No matter what you say, I still can't believe\n That you would walk away.\n It don't make sense to me, but:\n \n [Repeat Chorus 1:]\n Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?\n Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?\n Why would you wanna make the very first scar?\n Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?\n \n It's not unbroken anymore.\n How do I get it back the way it was before?\n \n [Chorus 2:]\n Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?\n Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?\n Why would you wanna make the very first scar?\n Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a:\n \n [Repeat Chorus 1:]\n Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?\n Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?\n Why would you wanna make the very first scar?\n Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?Last Christmas I gave you my heart\n But the very next day, you gave it away\n This year, to save me from tears\n I'll give it to someone special\n \n Once bitten and twice shied\n I keep my distance but you still catch my eye\n Tell me baby\n Do you recognize me\n Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me\n Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it\n With a note saying 'I love you', I meant it\n Now I know what a fool I've been\n But if you kiss me now, I know you'd fool me again\n \n Last Christmas I gave you my heart\n But the very next day, you gave it away\n This year, to save me from tears\n I'll give it to someone special\n \n Last Christmas I gave you my heart\n But the very next day, you gave it away\n This year, to save me from tears\n I'll give it to someone special\n \n A crowded room and friends with tired eyes\n I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice\n My God, I thought you were someone to rely on\n Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on\n A face on a lover with a fire in his heart\n A girl on a cover but you tore her apart\n Maybe this year\n Maybe this year I'll give it to someone special\n \n Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart\n But the very next day, you gave it away\n This year, to save me from tears\n I'll give it to someone special\n \n Last Christmas I gave you my heart\n But the very next day, you gave it away\n This year, to save me from tears\n I'll give it to someone special\n \n And last Christmas\n And this year\n It won't be anything like, anything like\n \n Last Christmas I gave you my heart\n But the very next day, you gave it away\n This year, to save me from tears\n I'll give it to someone specialPlease take down the misletoe\n Cause I don't wanna think about that right now\n Cause everything I want is miles away\n In a snow covered little town\n My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me\n Season's greetings, hope you're well\n Well I'm doing alright\n If you were wondering\n Lately I can never tell\n \n I know this shouldn't be a lonely time\n But there were Christmases when you were mine\n \n I've been doing fine without you, really\n Up until the nights got cold\n And everybody's here, except you, baby\n Seems like everyone's got someone to hold\n \n But for me it's just a lonely time\n Cause there were Christmases when you were mine\n \n Merry Christmas everybody\n That'll have to be something I just say this year\n I'll bet you got your mom another sweater\n And were your cousins late again\n When you were putting up the lights this year\n Did you notice one less pair of hands\n \n I know this shouldn't be a lonely time\n But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight\n Cause there were Christmases when you were mine\n \n You were mineSanta baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me\n I've been an awful good girl, santa baby\n So hurry down the chimney tonight\n \n Santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue\n Well I'll wait up for you, dear, santa baby\n So hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah\n \n Think of all the fun I've missed\n Think of all the boys I haven't kissed\n Next year I could be just as good\n If you check off my Christmas list\n \n Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot\n I've been an angel all year, santa baby\n So hurry down the chimney tonight\n \n Santa, honey, there's one more thing I really do need, the deed\n To a platinum mine, santa honey\n So hurry down the chimney tonight\n \n Come and trim my Christmas tree\n With some decorations bought at Tiffany's\n I really do believe in you\n Let's see if you believe in me\n \n Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing\n A ring\n And I don't mean on the phone, santa baby\n So hurry down the chimney tonightSilent night, holy night\n All is calm and all is bright\n Round yon virgin mother and child\n Holy infant so tender and mild\n Sleep in heavenly peace\n Sleep in heavenly peace\n \n Silent night, holy night\n Shepherds quake at the sight\n Glories stream from Heaven afar\n Heavenly hosts sing halleluia\n Christ the savior is born\n Christ our savior is born\n \n Silent night, holy night\n Son of God\n Love's pure light\n Radiant beams from thy holy face\n With the dawn of redeeming grace\n Jesus Lord at thy birth\n Jesus Lord at thy birth\n \n Halleluia!\n Halleluia!\n Halleluia!\n \n Christ the savior is bornWhat if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing?\n Would the song still survive without five golden rings?\n Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe?\n What would happen if God never let it snow?\n What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie?\n Tell me what would you find\n \n You'd see that today holds something special\n Something holy, not superficial\n So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives\n It's something we all try to ignore\n And put a wreath up on your door\n So here's something you should know that is for sure\n Christmas must be something more\n \n What if angels did not pay attention to\n All the things that we wished they would always do?\n What if happiness came in a cardboard box?\n Then I think there is something we all forgot\n What would happen if presents all went away?\n Tell me what would you find\n \n You'd see that today holds something special\n Something holy, not superficial\n So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives\n It's something we all try to ignore\n And put a wreath up on your door\n So here's something you should know that is for sure\n Christmas must be something more\n \n We get so caught up in all of it\n Business and relationships\n Hundred mile an hour lives\n And it's this time of year\n And everybody's here\n It seems the last thing on your mind\n \n Is that the day holds something special\n Something holy, not superficial?\n So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives\n It's something we all try to ignore\n And put a wreath up on your door\n But here's something you should know that is for sure\n

upon a time\n I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye\n And we caught onto something\n I hold onto the night\n You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me\n Were you just kidding cause it seems to me\n This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak\n I don't feel welcome anymore\n Baby, what happened, please tell me\n Cause one second it was perfect\n Now you're half way out the door\n \n And I stare at the phone\n He still hasn't called\n And then you feel so low\n You can't feel nothing at all\n And you flashback to\n When he said forever and always\n Oh, and it rains in your bedroom\n Everything is wrong\n It rains when you're here\n And it rains when you're gone\n I was there when you said forever and always\n \n Was I out of line?\n Did I say something way too honest?\n Made you run and hide like a scared little boy\n I looked into your eyes\n Thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure\n So here's to everything coming down to nothing\n Here's to silence that cuts me to the core\n Where is this going?\n Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore\n \n And I stare at the phone\n He still hasn't called\n And then you feel so low\n You can't feel nothing at all\n And you flashback to\n When he said forever and always\n And it rains in your bedroom\n Everything is wrong\n It rains when you're here\n And it rains when you're gone\n I was there when you said forever and always\n \n You didn't mean it baby\n I don't think so, oh oh oh\n Back up, baby back up\n Did you forget everything?\n Back up, baby back up\n Did you forget everything?\n \n Back up, baby back up\n Please back up, oh back up\n Back up, baby back up\n \n Cause it rains in your bedroom\n Everything is wrong\n It rains when you're here\n And it rains when you're gone\n I was there when you said forever and always\n \n And I stare at the phone\n He still hasn't called\n And then you feel so low\n You can't feel nothing at all\n And you flashback to\n When we said forever and always\n Cause it rains in your bedroom\n Everything is wrong\n It rains when you're here\n And it rains when you're gone\n I was there when you said forever and always\n \n You didn't mean it baby\n You said forever and always, yeahI could go back to every laugh,\n But I don't wanna' go there anymore,\n And I know all the steps up to your door,\n But I don't wanna' go

face\n And I knew from the first note played\n I'd be breaking all my rules to see you\n You smile that beautiful smile and\n All the girls in the front row scream your name\n \n So dim that spotlight, tell me things like\n I can't take my eyes off of you\n I'm no one special, just another\n Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you\n Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar\n \n Good morning loneliness, comes around when I'm not\n Dreaming about you\n When my world wakes up today\n You'll be in another town\n And I knew when I saw your face, I'd be\n Counting down the ways to see you\n You smile that beautiful smile and\n All the girls in the front row scream your name\n \n So dim that spotlight, tell me things like\n I can't take my eyes off of you\n I'm no one special, just another\n Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you\n Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar\n \n You played in bars, you play guitar\n I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are\n And you'll never see, sing me to sleep\n Every night from the radio\n \n So dim that spotlight, tell me things like\n I can't take my eyes off of you\n I'm no one special, just another\n Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you\n Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar\n Sweet, sweet superstar, superstarIn the heat of the fight I walked away\n Ignoring words that you were saying\n Trying to make me stay\n I said, \"This time I've had enough.\"\n And you've called a hundred times\n But I'm not picking up\n \n 'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over\n But if you look a little closer\n \n I said, \"Leave,\" but all I really want is you\n To stand outside my window throwing pebbles\n Screaming, \"I'm in love with you.\"\n Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more\n And don't you leave 'cause I know\n All I need is on the other side of the door\n \n Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone\n Going through the photographs, staring at the phone\n I keep going back over things we both said\n And I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread\n \n So babe if you know everything, tell me why you couldn't see\n When I left I wanted you to chase after me\n \n Yeah, I said, \"Leave,\" but all I really want is you\n To stand outside my window throwing pebbles\n Screaming, \"I'm in love with you.\"\n Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more\n And don't you leave 'cause I know\n All I need is on the other side of the door\n \n And I'll scream out the window\n I can't even look at you\n I don't need you but I do, I do, I do\n I say, \"There's nothing you can say to make this right again.\n I mean it, I mean it.\"\n What I mean is...\n \n I said, \"Leave,\" but baby all I want is you\n To stand outside my window throwing pebbles\n Screaming, \"I'm in love with you.\"\n Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more\n And don't you leave 'cause I know\n All I need is on the other side of the door\n \n With your face and the beautiful eyes\n And the conversation with the little white lies\n And the faded picture of a beautiful night\n You carry me from your car up the stairs\n And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?\n After everything and that little black dress\n After everything I must confess, I need youThere's somethin' 'bout the way\n The street looks when it's just rained\n There's a glow off the pavement\n You walk me to the car\n And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there\n In the middle of the parking lot\n Yeah\n Oh yeah\n \n We're drivin' down the road\n I wonder if you know\n I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now\n But you're just so cool\n Run your hands through your hair\n Absent-mindedly makin' me want you\n \n And I don't know how it gets better than this\n You take my hand and drag me head first\n Fearless\n And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress\n Fearless\n \n So, baby, drive slow\n 'Til we run out of road in this one horse town\n I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat\n You put your eyes on me\n In this moment now capture it, remember it\n \n 'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this\n You take my hand and drag me head first\n Fearless\n And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress\n Fearless\n \n Well, you stood there with me in the doorway\n My hands shake\n I'm not usually this way\n But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave\n It's the first kiss,\n It's flawless,\n Really something,\n It's fearless.\n \n Oh yeah\n \n 'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this\n You take my hand and drag me head first\n Fearless\n And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress\n Fearless\n \n 'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this\n You take my hand and drag me head first\n Fearless\n And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress\n Fearless\n \n Oh-oh\n Oh yeahYou take a deep breath and you walk through the doors\n It's the morning of your very first day\n You say \"Hi\" to your friends you ain't seen in a while\n Try and stay out of everybody's way\n It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here\n For the next four years in this town\n Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say,\n \"You know I haven't seen you around before.\"\n \n 'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\n You're gonna believe them\n And when you're fifteen\n Feeling like there's nothing to figure out\n Well count to ten, take it in\n This is life before you know who you're gonna be\n Fifteen\n \n You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail\n And soon enough you're best friends\n Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool\n We'll be out of here as soon as we can\n And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car\n And you're feeling like flying\n And you're momma's waiting up and you think he's the one\n And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends\n When the night ends\n \n 'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\n You're gonna believe them\n When you're fifteen and your first kiss\n Makes your head spin round but\n In your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy of the football team\n But I didn't know it at fifteen\n \n When all you wanted was to be wanted\n Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now\n Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday\n But I realized some bigger dreams of mine\n \n And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy\n Who changed his mind and we both cried\n \n 'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\n You're gonna believe them\n And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall\n I've found that time can heal most anything\n And you just might find who you're supposed to be\n I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen\n \n La la la la la la la\n La la la la la la la\n La la la la la la la\n \n Your very first day\n Take a deep breath, girl\n Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors.We were both young when I first saw you.\n I close my eyes and the flashback starts:\n I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air.\n \n See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.\n See you make your way through the crowd\n And say, \"Hello, \"\n Little did I know...\n \n That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles,\n And my daddy said, \"Stay away from Juliet\"\n And I was crying on the staircase\n Begging you, \"Please don't go\"\n And I said...\n \n Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.\n I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.\n You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,\n It's a love story, baby, just say, \"Yes\".\n \n So I sneak out to the garden to see you.\n We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew\n So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.\n Oh, oh.\n \n 'Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,\n And my daddy said, \"Stay away from Juliet\"\n But you were everything to me,\n I was begging you, \"Please don't go\"\n And I said...\n \n Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.\n I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.\n You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.\n It's a love story, baby, just say, \"Yes\".\n \n Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.\n This love is difficult but it's real.\n Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.\n It's a love story, baby, just say, \"Yes\".\n \n Oh, oh, oh.\n \n I got tired of waiting\n Wondering if you were ever coming around.\n My faith in you was fading\n When I met you on the outskirts of town.\n And I said...\n \n Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone.\n I keep waiting for you but you never come.\n Is this in my head? I don't know what to think.\n He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...\n \n Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.\n I love you, and that's all I really know.\n I talked to your dad - go pick out a white dress\n It's a love story, baby, just say, \"Yes\".\n \n Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.\n \n 'Cause we were both young when I first saw youHey Stephen,\n I know looks can be deceiving\n But I know I saw a light in you.\n And as we walked\n We were talking \n I didn't say half the things I wanted to.\n \n Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window\n I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold.\n Hey Stephen,\n Boy, you might have me believing\n I don't always have to be alone.\n \n [Chorus:]\n 'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel,\n Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.\n So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.\n Can't help it if there's no one else.\n Mmm, I can't help myself.\n \n Hey Stephen,\n I've been holding back this feeling.\n So I've got some things to say to you, ha.\n I seen it all \n So I thought \n But I never seen nobody shine the way you do.\n \n The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name \n It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change.\n Hey Stephen,\n Why are people always leaving?\n I think you and I should stay the same.\n \n [Chorus]\n \n They're dimming the street lights.\n You're perfect for me, why aren't you here tonight?\n I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out and pull me near to shine, shine, shine.\n \n Hey Stephen,\n I could give you fifty reasons\n Why I should be the one you choose.\n All those other girls \n Well, they're beautiful\n But would they write a song for you?\n \n [Chorus:]\n I can't help it if you look like an angel,\n Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.\n So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.\n Can't help it if there's no one else.\n Mmm, I can't help myself...\n ...if you look like an angel.\n Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.\n So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.\n Can't help it if there's no one else.\n Mmm, I can't help myself.\n \n Myself,\n Can't help myself,\n I can't help myself.Say you're sorry\n That face of an angel\n Comes out just when you need it to\n As I paced back and forth all this time\n 'Cause I honestly believed in you\n Holding on\n The days drag on\n Stupid girl,\n I should have known, I should have known\n \n [Chorus:]\n That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale,\n I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,\n Lead her up the stairwell\n This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,\n I was a dreamer before you went and let me down,\n Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around\n \n Maybe I was naive,\n Got lost in your eyes\n And never really had a chance\n My mistake, I didn't know to be in love\n You had to fight to have the upper hand\n I had so many dreams\n About you and me\n Happy endings\n Now I know\n \n [Chorus:]\n That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale,\n I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,\n Lead her up the stairwell\n This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,\n I was a dreamer before you went and let me down,\n Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around\n \n And there you are on your knees,\n Begging for forgiveness, begging for me\n Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry\n \n 'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale,\n I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well\n This is a big world, that was a small town\n They're in my rear view mirror disappearing now\n And it's too late for you and your white horse\n Now it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me now\n \n Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa\n Try and catch me now\n Oh, it's too late\n To catch me nowYou're on the phone with your girlfriend\n She's upset, she's going off about something that you said\n 'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.\n \n I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.\n I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.\n And she'll never know your story like I do.\n \n But she wears short skirts\n I wear t-shirts\n She's cheer captain\n And I'm on the bleachers\n Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find\n That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.\n \n If you could see\n That I'm the one\n Who understands you.\n Been here all along.\n So, why can't you see\n You belong with me,\n You belong with me.\n \n Walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans\n I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.\n Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself,\n \"Hey, isn't this easy?\"\n \n And you've got a smile\n That could light up this whole town.\n I haven't seen it in a while\n Since she brought you down.\n \n You say you're fine I know you better than that.\n Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?\n \n She wears high heels,\n I wear sneakers.\n She's cheer captain,\n And I'm on the bleachers.\n Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find\n That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.\n \n If you could see\n That I'm the one\n Who understands you,\n Been here all along.\n So, why can't you see\n You belong with me.\n \n Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.\n All this time how could you not know, baby?\n You belong with me,\n You belong with me.\n \n [Instrumental]\n \n Oh, I remember you driving to my house\n In the middle of the night.\n I'm the one who makes you laugh\n When you know you're 'bout to cry.\n I know your favorite songs,\n And you tell me about your dreams.\n Think I know where you belong,\n Think I know it's with me.\n \n Can't you see\n That I'm the one\n Who understands you?\n Been here all along.\n So, why can't you see\n You belong with me.\n \n Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.\n All this time how could you not know, baby?\n You belong with me,\n You belong with me.\n \n You belong with me.\n \n Have you ever thought just maybe\n You belong with me?\n You belong with me.I see your face in my mind as I drive away,\n Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way.\n People are people, and sometimes we change our minds.\n But it's killing me to see you go after all this time.\n \n Mmm mmm mmm\n Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm\n Mmm mmm mmm\n Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm\n \n Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie,\n It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see.\n Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down,\n Now I don't know what to be without you around.\n \n And we know it's never simple, never easy.\n Never a clean break, no one here to save me.\n You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,\n \n And I can't breathe without you\n But I have to.\n Breathe without you\n But I have to.\n \n Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt.\n Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve.\n People are people, and sometimes it doesn't work out,\n Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out.\n \n And we know it's never simple, never easy.\n Never a clean break, no one here to save me.\n You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,\n \n And I can't breathe without you\n But I have to.\n Breathe without you\n But I have to.\n \n It's two A.M.\n Feelin' like I just lost a friend.\n Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me.\n It's two A.M.\n Feelin' like I just lost a friend.\n Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me.\n \n And we know it's never simple, never easy.\n Never a clean break, no one here to save me.\n \n Ohhh\n \n And I can't breathe without you\n But I have to.\n Breathe without you\n But I have to.\n Breathe without you\n But I have to.\n \n I'm sorry (oh)\n I'm sorry (mmm)\n I'm sorry (eh eh)\n I'm sorry (mmm)\n I'm sorry (eh eh)\n I'm sorry (mmm)\n I'm sorryI took a chance, I took a shot \n And you might think i'm bulletproof, but i'm not \n You took a swing, I took it hard \n And down here from the ground I see who you are \n \n I'm sick and tired of your attitude \n I'm feeling like I don't know you \n You tell me that you love me then you cut me down \n And I need you like a heartbeat \n But you know you got a mean streak \n Makes me run for cover when you're around \n And here's to you and your temper \n Yes, I remember what you said last night \n And I know that you see what you're doing to me \n Tell me why.. \n \n You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day \n Well I get so confused and frustrated \n Forget what i'm trying to say, oh \n \n I'm sick and tired of your reasons \n I got no one to believe in \n You tell me that you want me, then push me around \n And I need you like a heartbeat \n But you know you got a mean streak \n Makes me run for cover when you're around \n Here's to you and your temper \n Yes, I remember what you said last night \n And I know that you see what you're doing to me \n Tell me why.. \n \n Why..do you have to make me feel small \n So you can feel whole inside \n Why..do you have to put down my dreams \n So you're the only thing on my mind \n \n I'm sick and tired of your attitude \n I'm feeling like I don't know you \n You tell me that you want me then cut me down \n I'm sick and tired of your reasons \n I've got no one to believe in \n You ask me for my love then you push me around \n Here's to you and your temper \n Yes, I remember what you said last night \n And I know that you see what you're doing to me \n Tell me why \n Why, tell me why \n \n I take a step back, let you go \n I told you i'm not bulletproof \n Now you knowAll this time I was wasting,\n Hoping you would come around\n I've been giving out chances every time\n And all you do is let me down\n And it's taken me this long\n Baby but I figured you out\n And you're thinking we'll be fine again,\n But not this time around\n \n You don't have to call anymore\n I won't pick up the phone\n This is the last straw\n Don't wanna hurt anymore\n And you can tell me that you're sorry\n But I don't believe you baby\n Like I did before\n You're not sorry, no no oh\n \n Looking so innocent,\n I might believe you if I didn't know\n Could've loved you all my life\n If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold\n And you got your share of secrets\n And I'm tired of being last to know\n And now you're asking me to listen\n Cause it's worked each time before\n \n But you don't have to call anymore\n I won't pick up the phone\n This is the last straw\n Don't wanna hurt anymore\n And you can tell me that you're sorry\n But I don't believe you baby\n Like I did before\n You're not sorry, no no, oh\n \n You're not sorry no no oh\n \n You had me crying for you honey\n And it never would've gone away, no\n You used to shine so bright\n But I watched all of it fade\n \n So you don't have to call anymore\n I won't pick up the phone\n This is the last straw\n There's nothing left to beg for\n And you can tell me that you're sorry\n But I don't believe you baby\n Like I did before\n You're not sorry, no no oh\n \n You're not sorry, no no ohHe is sensible and so incredible \n And all my single friends are jealous \n He says everything I need to hear and it's like \n I couldn't ask for anything better \n He opens up my door and I get into his car \n And he says you look beautiful tonight \n And I feel perfectly fine \n \n But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain \n And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name \n You're so in love that you act insane \n And that's the way I loved you \n Breakin' down and coming undone \n It's a roller coaster kinda rush \n And I never knew I could feel that much \n And that's the way I loved you \n \n He respects my space \n And never makes me wait \n And he calls exactly when he says he will \n He's close to my mother \n Talks business with my father \n He's charming and endearing \n And I'm comfortable \n \n But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain \n And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name \n You're so in love that you act insane \n And that's the way I loved you \n Breakin' down and coming undone \n It's a roller coaster kinda rush \n And I never knew I could feel that much \n And that's the way I loved you \n \n He can't see the smile I'm faking \n And my heart's not breaking \n Cause I'm not feeling anything at all \n And you were wild and crazy \n Just so frustrating intoxicating \n Complicated, got away by some mistake and now \n \n I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain \n It's 2am and I'm cursing your name \n I'm so in love that I acted insane \n And that's the way I loved you \n Breaking down and coming undone \n It's a roller coaster kinda rush \n And I never knew I could feel that much \n And that's the way I loved you oh, oh \n \n And that's the way I loved you oh, oh \n Never knew I could feel that much \n And that's the way I loved youOnce upon a time,\n I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye\n And we caught onto something\n I hold onto the night,\n You looked me in the eye\n And told me you loved me\n \n Were you just kidding?\n 'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down\n We almost never speak\n I don't feel welcome anymore\n Baby, what happened, please tell me?\n 'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're half way out the door\n \n And I stare at the phone,\n He still hasn't called\n And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all\n And you flashback to when he said forever and always\n Oh, and it rains in your bedroom\n Everything is wrong\n It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\n 'Cause I was there when you said forever and always\n \n Was I out of line?\n Did I say something way too honest?\n Made you run and hide\n Like a scared little boy?\n I looked into your eyes\n Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure\n \n So here's to everything\n Coming down to nothing\n Here's to silence\n That cuts me to the core\n Where is this going?\n Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore\n \n And I stare at the phone,\n He still hasn't called\n And then you feel so low, you can't feel nothing at all\n And you flashback to when he said forever and always\n Oh, and it rains in your bedroom\n Everything is wrong\n It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\n 'Cause I was there when you said forever and always\n \n You didn't mean it, baby,\n I don't think so\n \n Back up, baby, back up\n Did you forget everything?\n Back up, baby, back up\n Did you forget everything?\n \n 'Cause it rains in your bedroom\n Everything is wrong\n It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\n 'Cause I was there when you said forever and always\n \n Oh, I stare at the phone,\n He still hasn't called\n And then you feel so low\n You can't feel nothing at all\n And you flashback to when we said forever and always\n \n And it rains in your bedroom\n Everything is wrong\n It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\n 'Cause I was there when you said forever and always\n \n You didn't mean it, baby,\n You said forever and always... yeahI'm five years old\n It's getting cold\n I've got my big coat on\n \n I hear your laugh\n And look up smiling at you\n I run and run\n \n Past the pumpkin patch\n And the tractor rides\n Look now -- the sky is gold\n I hug your legs and fall asleep\n On the way home\n \n I don't know why all the trees change in the fall\n I know you're not scared of anything at all\n Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away\n But I know I had the best day\n With you today\n \n I'm thirteen now\n And don't know how my friends\n Could be so mean\n \n I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys\n \n And we drive and drive\n Until we've found a town\n Far enough away\n \n And we talk and window-shop\n Until I've forgotten all their names\n \n I don't know who I'm gonna talk to\n Now at school\n I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you\n Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay\n But I know I had the best day\n With you today\n \n I have an excellent father\n His strength is making me stronger\n God smiles on my little brother\n Inside and out\n He's better than I am\n \n I grew up in a pretty house\n And I had space to run\n And I had the best days with you\n \n There is a video\n I found from back when I was three\n You set up a paint set in the kitchen\n And you're talking to me\n \n It's the age of princesses and pirate ships\n And the seven dwarfs\n Daddy's smart\n And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world\n \n Now I know why all the trees change in the fall\n I know you were on my side\n Even when I was wrong\n And I love you for giving me your eyes\n Staying back and watching me shine\n \n And I didn't know if you knew\n So I'm taking this chance to say\n That I had the best day\n With you todayAnd its a sad picture,\n The final blow hits you\n Somebody else gets what you wanted again\n And you know its all the same,\n Another time and place\n Repeating history and youre getting sick of it\n \n But I believe in whatever you do\n And Ill do anything to see it through\n \n Because these things will change\n Can you feel it now?\n These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down\n This revolution, the time will come\n For us to finally win\n And well sing hallelujah, well sing hallelujah\n \n So weve been outnumbered\n Raided and now cornered\n Its hard to fight when the fight aint fair\n Were getting stronger now\n Find things they never found\n They might be bigger\n But were faster and never scared\n \n You can walk away, say we dont need this\n But theres something in your eyes says we can beat this\n \n 'Cause these things will change\n Can you feel it now?\n These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down\n This revolution, the time will come\n For us to finally win\n And well sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah\n \n Tonight we'll stand, get off our knees\n Fight for what weve worked for all these years\n And the battle was long, its the fight of our lives\n But well stand up champions tonight\n \n It was the night things changed\n Can you see it now?\n These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down\n This revolution, throw your hands up\n 'Cause we never gave in\n And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah\n HallelujahUh, oh, oh\n Uh, oh, oh\n \n You were in college working part time waiting tables\n Left a small town, never looked back\n I was a flight risk with a fear of fallin\n Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts\n \n I say, \"Can you believe it?\"\n As were lying on the couch\n The moment I can see it.\n Yes, yes, I can see it now.\n \n Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?\n You put your arm around me for the first time.\n You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter.\n You are the best thing thats ever been mine.\n \n Flash forward and were taking on the world together,\n And theres a drawer of my things at your place.\n You learn my secrets and you figure out why Im guarded,\n You say well never make my parents mistakes.\n \n But we got bills to pay,\n We got nothing figured out,\n When it was hard to take,\n Yes, yes, this is what I thought about.\n \n Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?\n You put your arm around me for the first time\n You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter\n You are the best thing thats ever been mine.\n \n Do you remember all the city lights on the water?\n You saw me start to believe for the first time\n You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter\n You are the best thing thats ever been mine.\n \n Oh, oh, oh, oh\n \n And I remember that fight\n Two-thirty AM\n As everything was slipping right out of our hands\n I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street\n Braced myself for the \"Goodbye.\"\n Cause thats all Ive ever known\n Then you took me by surprise\n You said, \"Ill never leave you alone.\"\n \n You said, \"I remember how we felt sitting by the water.\n And every time I look at you, its like the first time.\n I fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter.\n She is the best thing thats ever been mine.\"\n \n Hold on, make it last\n Hold on, never turn back\n \n You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter\n You are the best thing thats ever been mine.\n \n (Hold on) do you believe it?\n (Hold on) we're gonna make it now.\n (Hold on) and I can see it,\n (Yes, yes) I can see it now (see it now, see it now...)The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm\n And I'm a house of cards\n You're the kind of reckless\n That should send me runnin'\n But I kinda know that I won't get far\n And you stood there in front of me\n Just close enough to touch\n Close enough to hope you couldn't see\n What I was thinking of\n \n Drop everything now\n Meet me in the pouring rain\n Kiss me on the sidewalk\n Take away the pain\n 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\n Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down\n Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around\n 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\n \n My mind forgets to remind me\n You're a bad idea\n You touch me once and it's really something,\n You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be.\n I'm on my guard for the rest of the world\n But with you I know it's no good\n And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would...\n \n Drop everything now\n Meet me in the pouring rain\n Kiss me on the sidewalk\n Take away the pain\n 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\n Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down\n Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around\n 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\n \n I'll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild.\n Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right.\n And lead me up the staircase\n Won't you whisper soft and slow?\n I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show.\n \n Drop everything now,\n Meet me in the pouring rain,\n Kiss me on the sidewalk,\n Take away the pain\n 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile.\n Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down\n Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around\n 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\n \n And the sparks fly...\n Oh, baby, smile...\n And the sparks fly...I'm so glad you made time to see me.\n How's life? Tell me how's your family?\n I haven't seen them in a while.\n You've been good, busier than ever,\n We small talk, work and the weather,\n Your guard is up and I know why.\n Because the last time you saw me\n Is still burned in the back of your mind.\n You gave me roses and I left them there to die.\n \n So this is me swallowing my pride,\n Standing in front of you saying, \"I'm sorry for that night,\"\n And I go back to December all the time.\n It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.\n Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.\n I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.\n I go back to December all the time.\n \n These days I haven't been sleeping,\n Staying up, playing back myself leavin'.\n When your birthday passed and I didn't call.\n And I think about summer, all the beautiful times,\n I watched you laughing from the passenger side.\n Realized I loved you in the fall.\n \n And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind\n You gave me all your love and all I gave you was \"Goodbye\".\n \n So this is me swallowing my pride\n Standing in front of you saying, \"I'm sorry for that night.\"\n And I go back to December all the time.\n It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,\n Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.\n I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind\n I go back to December all the time.\n \n I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile,\n So good to me, so right\n And how you held me in your arms that September night\n The first time you ever saw me cry.\n \n Maybe this is wishful thinking,\n Probably mindless dreaming,\n But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right.\n \n I'd go back in time and change it but I can't.\n So if the chain is on your door I understand.\n \n But this is me swallowing my pride\n Standing in front of you saying, \"I'm sorry for that night.\"\n And I go back to December...\n It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,\n Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.\n I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.\n I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind\n \n I go back to December all the time.\n All the time.I am not the kind of girl\n Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion\n But you are not the kind of boy\n Who should be marrying the wrong girl\n \n I sneak in and see your friends\n And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel\n And she is yelling at a bridesmaid\n Somewhere back inside a room\n Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry\n \n This is surely not what you thought it would be\n I lose myself in a daydream\n Where I stand and say\n \n [Chorus:]\n Dont say \"Yes\", run away now\n Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door\n Dont wait or say a single vow\n You need to hear me out\n And they said, \"Speak now.\"\n \n Fond gestures are exchanged\n And the organ starts to play\n A song that sounds like a death march\n And I am hiding in the curtains\n It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be\n \n She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen\n But I know you wish it was me,\n You wish it was me,\n Dont you?\n \n [Chorus:]\n Dont say \"Yes\", run away now,\n Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.\n Dont wait or say a single vow,\n You need to hear me out,\n And they said, \"Speak now.\"\n Dont say \"Yes\", run away now,\n Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.\n Dont wait or say a single vow,\n Your time is running out,\n And they said, \"Speak now.\"\n \n Oh, la, la\n Oh, oh\n Say a single vow\n \n I hear the preacher say, \"Speak now or forever hold your peace.\"\n Theres the silence, theres my last chance.\n I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me.\n Horrified looks from everyone in the room\n But Im only looking at you.\n \n I am not the kind of girl\n Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion\n But you are not the kind of boy\n Who should be marrying the wrong girl\n \n [Chorus:]\n So, dont say \"Yes\", run away now,\n Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.\n Dont wait or say a single vow,\n You need to hear me out,\n And they said, \"Speak now.\"\n And you say, \"Lets run away now,\n Ill meet you when Im out of my tux at the back door.\n Baby, I didnt say my vows,\n So glad you were around\n When they said, \"Speak now.\"Long were the nights when\n My days once revolved around you\n Counting my footsteps\n Praying the floor wont fall through, again\n And my mother accused me of losing my mind\n But I swore I was fine\n \n You paint me a blue sky\n And go back and turn it to rain\n And I lived in your chess game\n But you changed the rules everyday\n Wonderin which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight\n Well I stopped pickin up and this song is to let you know why\n \n Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.\n Don't you think I was too young\n To be messed with?\n The girl in the dress\n Cried the whole way home, I should've known.\n \n Well maybe its me\n And my blind optimism to blame\n Or maybe its you and your sick need\n To give love then take it away\n \n And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand\n And I'll look back in regret how I ignored when they said,\n \"Run as fast as you can.\"\n \n Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.\n Don't you think I was too young\n To be messed with?\n The girl in the dress\n Cried the whole way home\n \n Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong\n Dont you think nineteens too young\n To be played by your dark, twisted games?\n When I loved you so, I should've known.\n \n You are an expert at \"Sorry\"\n And keeping lines blurry\n Never impressed by me acing your tests\n All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes\n Cause you've burned them out\n \n But I took your matches\n Before fire could catch me\n So dont look now\n Im shining like fireworks\n Over your sad empty town\n \n Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.\n Don't you think I was too young\n To be messed with?\n The girl in the dress\n Cried the whole way home\n \n I see it all now that you're gone\n Don't you think I was too young\n To be messed with?\n The girl in the dress\n Wrote you a song, you shouldve known.\n \n You shouldve known\n Dont you think I was too young?\n You shouldve known.You, with your words like knives\n And swords and weapons that you use against me\n You have knocked me off my feet again\n Got me feeling like a nothing\n You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard\n Calling me out when I'm wounded\n You, picking on the weaker man\n \n Well you can take me down with just one single blow\n But you don't know, what you don't know...\n \n Someday I'll be living in a big ole city\n And all you're ever gonna be is mean\n Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me\n And all you're ever gonna be is mean\n Why you gotta be so mean?\n \n You, with your switching sides\n And your wildfire lies and your humiliation\n You have pointed out my flaws again\n As if I don't already see them\n I walk with my head down\n Trying to block you out 'cause I'll never impress you\n I just wanna feel okay again\n \n I bet you got pushed around\n Somebody made you cold\n But the cycle ends right now\n 'Cause you can't lead me down that road\n And you don't know, what you don't know...\n \n Someday I'll be living in a big ole city\n And all you're ever gonna be is mean\n Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me\n And all you're ever gonna be is mean\n Why you gotta be so mean?\n \n And I can see you years from now in a bar\n Talking over a football game\n With that same big loud opinion\n But nobody's listening\n Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things\n Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing\n But all you are is mean\n \n All you are is mean\n And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life\n And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean\n \n But someday I'll be living in a big ole city\n And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah\n Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me\n And all you're ever gonna be is mean\n Why you gotta be so?...\n \n Someday I'll be living in a big ole city (Why you gotta be so?...)\n And all you're ever gonna be is mean (Why you gotta be so?...)\n Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me (Why you gotta be so?...)\n And all you're ever gonna be is mean\n Why you gotta be so mean?I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us,\n How we met and the sparks flew instantly,\n and people would say, \"They're the lucky ones.\"\n I used to know my place was the spot next to you,\n Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat,\n 'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on.\n \n Oh, a simple complication,\n Miscommunications lead to fall-out.\n So many things that I wish you knew,\n So many walls up I can't break through.\n \n [Chorus:]\n Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,\n And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?\n I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,\n And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.\n \n Next chapter.\n \n How'd we end up this way?\n See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy,\n And you're doing your best to avoid me.\n I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us,\n How I was losing my mind when I saw you here,\n But you held your pride like you should've held me.\n \n Oh, I'm scared to see the ending,\n Why are we pretending this is nothing?\n I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how,\n I've never heard silence quite this loud.\n \n [Chorus:]\n Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,\n And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?\n I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,\n And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.\n \n This is looking like a contest,\n Of who can act like they care less,\n But I liked it better when you were on my side.\n The battle's in your hands now,\n But I would lay my armor down\n If you said you'd rather love than fight.\n So many things that you wish I knew,\n But the story of us might be ending soon.\n \n [Chorus:]\n Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,\n And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?\n I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,\n And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now.\n And we're not speaking,\n And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?\n I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate 'cause we're going down,\n And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.\n \n The end.Your little hand's wrapped around my finger\n And it's so quiet in the world tonight\n Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming\n So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light\n To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret\n I'd give all I have, honey\n If you could stay like that\n \n Oh darling, don't you ever grow up\n Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little\n Oh darling, don't you ever grow up\n Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple\n I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart\n And no one will desert you\n Just try to never grow up, never grow up\n \n You're in the car on the way to the movies\n And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off\n At 14 there's just so much you can't do\n And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots\n But don't make her drop you off around the block\n Remember that she's getting older too\n And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school\n \n Oh darling, don't you ever grow up\n Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little\n Oh darling, don't you ever grow up\n Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple\n No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred\n And even though you want to, just try to never grow up\n \n Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room\n Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home\n Remember the footsteps, remember the words said\n And all your little brother's favorite songs\n I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone\n \n So here I am in my new apartment\n In a big city, they just dropped me off\n It's so much colder than I thought it would be\n So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on\n \n Wish I'd never grown up\n I wish I'd never grown up\n \n Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up\n I could still be little\n Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up\n It could still be simple\n Oh darling, don't you ever grow up\n Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little\n Oh darling, don't you ever grow up\n Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple\n Won't let nobody hurt you\n Won't let no one break your heart\n And even though you want to, please try to never grow up\n Oh, don't you ever grow up\n Oh, never grow up, just never grow upThere I was again tonight\n Forcing laughter, faking smiles\n Same old tired lonely place\n \n Walls of insincerity,\n Shifting eyes and vacancy\n Vanished when I saw your face\n \n All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you\n \n Your eyes whispered, \"Have we met?\"\n Across the room your silhouette\n Starts to make its way to me\n The playful conversation starts\n Counter all your quick remarks\n Like passing notes in secrecy\n \n And it was enchanting to meet you\n All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you\n \n This night is sparkling, don't you let it go\n I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home\n I'll spend forever wondering if you knew\n I was enchanted to meet you\n \n The lingering question kept me up\n 2 AM, who do you love?\n I wonder 'til I'm wide awake\n And now I'm pacing back and forth\n Wishing you were at my door\n I'd open up and you would say, \"Hey,\n It was enchanting to meet you,\n All I know is I was enchanted to meet you.\"\n \n This night is sparkling, don't you let it go\n I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home\n I'll spend forever wondering if you knew\n This night is flawless, don't you let it go\n I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone\n I'll spend forever wondering if you knew\n I was enchanted to meet you\n \n This is me praying that\n This was the very first page\n Not where the story line ends\n My thoughts will echo your name\n Until I see you again\n These are the words I held back\n As I was leaving too soon\n I was enchanted to meet you\n \n Please don't be in love with someone else\n Please don't have somebody waiting on you\n Please don't be in love with someone else\n Please don't have somebody waiting on you\n \n This night is sparkling, don't you let it go\n I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home\n I'll spend forever wondering if you knew\n This night is flawless, don't you let it go\n I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone\n I'll spend forever wondering if you knew\n I was enchanted to meet you\n \n Please don't be in love with someone else\n Please don't have somebody waiting on you\"Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did\"\n \n Ha!\n Time for a little revenge\n \n The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and...\n I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him\n She came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause\n She took him faster than you could say \"sabotage\"\n \n I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it\n I underestimated just who I was dealing with\n She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum\n She underestimated just who she was stealing from\n \n She's not a saint\n And she's not what you think\n She's an actress, whoa\n She's better known\n For the things that she does\n On the mattress, whoa\n Soon she's gonna find\n Stealing other people's toys\n On the playground won't\n Make you many friends\n She should keep in mind\n She should keep in mind\n There is nothing I do better than revenge\n \n She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list\n She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it\n I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling\n And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things\n \n But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know\n Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go\n They wouldn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me\n But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity\n \n She's not a saint\n And she's

it break.\n Never thought I'd see it...I still remember the look on your face\n Lit through the darkness at 1:58\n The words that you whispered\n For just us to know\n You told me you loved me\n So why did you go away?\n Away\n \n I do recall now the smell of the rain\n Fresh on the pavement\n I ran off the plane\n That July 9th\n The beat of your heart\n It jumps through your shirt\n I can still feel your arms\n \n But now I'll go sit on the floor\n Wearing your clothes\n All that I know is\n I don't know how to be something you miss\n I never thought we'd have a last kiss\n Never imagined we'd end like this\n Your name, forever the name on my lips\n \n I do remember the swing of your step\n The life of the party, you're showing off again\n And I roll my eyes and then\n You pull me in\n I'm not much for dancing\n But for you I did\n \n Because I love your handshake, meeting my father\n I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets\n How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something\n There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions\n \n And I'll go sit on the floor\n Wearing your clothes\n All that I know is\n I don't know how to be something you miss\n Never thought we'd have a last kiss\n Never imagined we'd end like this\n Your name, forever the name on my lips\n \n So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep\n And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe\n And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are\n Hope it's nice where you are\n \n And I hope the sun shines\n And it's a beautiful day\n And something reminds you\n You wish you had stayed\n You can plan for a change in weather and time\n But I never planned on you changing your mind\n \n So I'll go sit on the floor\n Wearing your clothes\n All that I know is\n I don't know how to be something you miss\n Never thought we'd have a last kiss\n Never imagined we'd end like this\n Your name, forever the name on my lips\n \n Just like our last kiss\n Forever the name on my lips\n Forever the name on my lips\n \n Just like our last...I said remember this moment in the back of my mind\n The time we stood with our shaking hands\n The crowds in stands went wild\n We were the Kings and the Queens\n And they read off our names\n The night you danced like you knew our lives\n Would never be the same\n You held your head like a hero\n On a history book page\n It was the end of a decade\n But the start of an age\n \n Long live the walls we crashed through\n How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\n I was screaming long live all the magic we made\n And bring on all the pretenders\n One day, we will be remembered\n \n I said remember this feeling\n I pass the pictures around\n Of all the years that we stood there\n On the side-lines wishing for right now\n We are the Kings and the Queens\n You traded your baseball cap for a crown\n When they gave us our trophies\n And we held them up for our town\n And the cynics were outraged\n Screaming, \"This is absurd!\"\n Cause for a moment a band of thieves\n In ripped up jeans got to rule the world\n \n Long live the walls we crashed through\n How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\n I was screaming long live all the magic we made\n And bring on all the pretenders\n I'm not afraid\n Long live all the mountains we moved\n I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you\n I was screaming long live that look on your face\n And bring on all the pretenders\n One day, we will be remembered\n \n Hold on to spinning around\n Confetti falls to the ground\n May these memories break our fall\n \n Will you take a moment, promise me this\n That you'll stand by me forever\n But if God forbid fate should step in\n And force us into a goodbye\n If you have children some day\n When they point to the pictures\n Please tell them my name\n Tell them how the crowds went wild\n Tell them how I hope they shine\n \n Long live the walls we crashed through\n I had the time of my life, with you\n Long, long live the walls we crashed through\n How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\n And I was screaming long live all the magic we made\n And bring on all the pretenders\n I'm not afraid\n Singing, long live all the mountains we moved\n I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you\n And long, long live the look on your face\n And bring on all the pretenders\n One day, we will be rememberedElevator buttons and morning air\n Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs\n If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares\n But right now my time is theirs\n \n Seems like there's always someone who disapproves\n They'll judge it like they know about me and you\n And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do\n The jury's out, but my choice is you\n \n So don't you worry your pretty little mind\n People throw rocks at things that shine\n And life makes love look hard\n The stakes are high, the water's rough\n But this love is ours\n \n You never know what people have up their sleeves\n Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me\n Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles\n But I don't care 'cause right now you're mine\n \n And you'll say\n Don't you worry your pretty little mind\n People throw rocks at things that shine\n And life makes love look hard\n The stakes are high, the water's rough\n But this love is ours\n \n And it's not theirs to speculate\n If it's wrong and\n Your hands are tough\n But they are where mine belong and\n I'll fight their doubt and give you faith\n With this song for you\n \n 'Cause I love the gap between your teeth\n And I love the riddles that you speak\n And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored\n 'Cause my heart is yours\n \n So don't you worry your pretty little mind\n People throw rocks at things that shine\n And life makes love look hard\n Don't you worry your pretty little mind\n People throw rocks at things that shine\n But they can't take what's ours\n They can't take what's ours\n \n The stakes are high, the water's rough\n But this love is oursLast night I heard my own heart beating\n Sounded like footsteps on my stairs\n Six months gone and I'm still reaching\n Even though I know you're not there\n I was playing back a thousand memories, baby\n Thinking 'bout everything we've been through\n Maybe I've been going back too much lately\n When time stood still and I had you\n \n Come back, come back, come back to me like\n You would, you would if this was a movie\n Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out\n Come back, come back, come back to me like\n You could, you could if you just said you're sorry\n I know that we could work it out somehow\n But if this was a movie you'd be here by now\n \n I know people change and these things happen\n But I remember how it was back then\n Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing\n 'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them,\n Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street\n Flashback to the night when you said to me,\n \"Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you,\n Not before I knew how much I had to lose.\"\n \n Come back, come back, come back to me like\n You would, you would if this was a movie\n Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out\n Come back, come back, come back to me like\n You could, you could if you just said you're sorry\n I know that we could work it out somehow\n But if this was a movie you'd be here by now\n \n If you're out there,\n If you're somewhere,\n If you're moving on,\n I've been waiting for you.\n Ever since you've been gone\n I just want it back the way it was before.\n And I just wanna see you back at my front door.\n And I'd say\n \n Come back, come back, come back to me like\n You would before you said, \"It's not that easy.\"\n Before the fight, before I locked you out\n But I take it all back now\n \n Come back, come back, come back to me like\n You would, you would if this was a movie\n Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out\n Come back, come back, come back to me like\n You could, you could if you just said you're sorry\n I know that we could work it out somehow\n But if this was a movie you'd be here by now\n \n You'd be here by now\n It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now\n Baby, what about the ending\n Oh, I thought you'd be here by now, whoa\n Thought you'd be here by nowTall, dark and superman\n He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away\n To save the world or go to work\n It's the same thing to me\n He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition\n I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him\n I hang on every word you say, yay\n And you smile and say, \"How are you? \"\n I say, \"Just fine\"\n I always forget to tell you, I love you, I love you... forever\n \n I watch superman fly away\n You've got a busy day today\n Go save the world, I'll be around\n I watch superman fly away\n Come back I'll be with you someday\n I'll be right here on the ground\n When you come back down\n \n Tall, dark and beautiful\n He's complicated, he's irrational\n But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah\n Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'\n He's not all bad like his reputation\n And I can't hear one single word they say\n And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be OK\n I always forget to tell you I love you, I loved you from the very first day\n \n I watch superman fly away\n You've got a busy day today\n Go save the world I'll be around\n I watch superman fly away\n Come back I'll be with you someday\n I'll be right here on the ground\n When you come back down\n \n And I watch you fly around the world\n And I hope you don't save some other girl\n Don't forget, don't forget about me\n I'm far away but I never let you go\n I'm lovestruck and looking out the window\n Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be\n Right here wishing the flowers were from you\n Wishing the card was from you\n Wishing the call was from you\n \n 'Cause I loved you from the very first day\n \n I watch superman fly away\n You've got a busy day today\n Go save the world, I'll be around...\n Forever and ever here\n I watch superman fly away\n I swear I'll be with you someday\n I'll be right here on the ground\n When you come back down\n \n La, la, la, la, la, la\n La, la, la, la, la, la\n \n When you come back downI'm walking fast through the traffic lights\n Busy streets and busy lives\n And all we know\n Is touch and go\n We are alone with our changing minds\n We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time\n \n And I never (never) saw you coming\n And I'll never (never) be the same\n \n You come around and the armor falls\n Pierce the room like a cannonball\n Now all we know is don't let go\n We are alone, just you and me\n Up in your room and our slates are clean\n Just twin fire signs\n Four blue eyes\n \n So you were never a saint\n And Ive loved in shades of wrong\n We learn to live with the pain\n Mosaic broken hearts\n But this love is brave and wild\n \n And I never (never) {[x8:] Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh-oh-ooh} saw you coming\n And I'll never (never) be the same\n \n This is a state of grace\n This is the worthwhile fight\n Love is a ruthless game\n Unless you play it good and right\n These are the hands of fate\n You're my Achilles heel\n This is the golden age of something good and right and real\n \n And I never (never) saw you coming\n And I'll never (never) be the same\n \n And I never (never) {[x8:] Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh-oh-ooh} saw you coming\n And I'll never (never) be the same\n \n This is a state of grace\n This is the worthwhile fight\n Love is a ruthless game\n Unless you play it good and right[Verse 1:]\n Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street\n Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly\n Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall\n Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all\n \n [Chorus:]\n Losing him was blue like I'd never known\n Missing him was dark grey all alone\n Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met\n But loving him was red\n Loving him was red\n \n [Verse 2:]\n Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you\n Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song\n Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer\n Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong\n \n [Chorus:]\n Losing him was blue like I'd never known\n Missing him was dark grey all alone\n Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met\n But loving him was red\n Oh, red\n Burning red\n \n [Bridge:]\n Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes\n Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go\n But moving on from him is impossible\n When I still see it all in my head\n In burning red\n Burning, it was red\n \n [Chorus:]\n Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known\n Missing him was dark grey all alone\n Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met\n 'Cause loving him was red\n Yeah, yeah, red\n We're burning red\n \n [Post-Chorus:]\n And that's why he's spinnin' 'round in my head\n Comes back to me, burning red\n Yeah, yeah\n \n His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end streetPut your lips close to mine\n As long as they don't touch\n Out of focus, eye to eye\n Till the gravity's too much\n And I'll do anything you say\n If you say it with your hands\n And I'd be smart to walk away,\n But you're quicksand\n \n This slope is treacherous\n This path is reckless\n This slope is treacherous\n And I, I, I like it\n \n I can't decide if it's a choice\n Getting swept away\n I hear the sound of my own voice\n Asking you to stay\n And all we are is skin and bone\n Trained to get along\n Forever going with the flow,\n But you're friction\n \n This slope is treacherous\n This path is reckless\n This slope is treacherous\n And I, I, I like it\n \n Two headlights shine through the sleepless night\n And I will get you, and get you alone\n Your name has echoed through my mind\n And I just think you should, think you should know\n That nothing safe is worth the drive and I would\n Follow you, follow you home...\n I'll follow you, follow you home...\n \n This hope is treacherous\n This daydream is dangerous\n This hope is treacherous\n I, I, I... I, I, I... I, I, I...\n \n Two headlights shine through the sleepless night\n And I will get you, and get you alone\n Your name has echoed through my mind\n And I just think you should, think you should know\n That nothing safe is worth the drive and I will\n Follow you, follow you home...\n I'll follow you, follow you home...\n I'll follow you, follow you home...\n I'll follow you, follow you home...\n \n This slope is treacherous\n I, I, I like it[Music video spoken part:]\n I think--I think when it's all over,\n It just comes back in flashes, you know?\n It's like a kaleidoscope of memories.\n It just all comes back. But he never does.\n I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen.\n It's not really anything he said or anything he did,\n It was the feeling that came along with it.\n And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again.\n But I don't know if I should.\n I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright.\n But I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you?\n Maybe he knew that when he saw me.\n I guess I just lost my balance.\n I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him.\n It was losing me.\n \n Once upon a time a few mistakes ago\n I was in your sights, you got me alone\n You found me, you found me, you found me\n I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that\n And when I fell hard you took a step back\n Without me, without me, without me\n \n And he's long gone when he's next to me\n And I realize the blame is on me\n \n 'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in\n So shame on me now\n Flew me to places I'd never been\n 'Til you put me down, oh\n I knew you were trouble when you walked in\n So shame on me now\n Flew me to places I'd never been\n Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground\n Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble\n Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble\n \n No apologies.

(What?)\n Then you come around again and say\n \"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me.\"\n Remember how that lasted for a day?\n I say, \"I hate you,\" we break up, you call me, \"I love you.\"\n \n Ooh, we called it off again last night\n But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you\n \n We are never ever ever getting back together,\n We are never ever ever getting back together,\n You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me\n But we are never ever ever ever getting back together\n \n Like, ever...\n \n I'm really gonna miss you picking fights\n And me falling for it screaming that I'm right\n And you would hide away and find your peace of mind\n With some indie record that's much cooler than mine\n \n Ooh, you called me up again tonight\n But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you\n \n We are never, ever, ever getting back together\n We are never, ever, ever getting back together\n You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)\n But we are never ever ever ever getting back together\n \n Ooh, yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah\n Oh oh oh\n \n I used to think that we were forever ever\n And I used to say, \"Never say never...\"\n Uggg... so he calls me up and he's like, \"I still love you,\"\n And I'm like... \"I just...

are never ever ever ever getting back togetherI'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night.\n I threw my phone across the room at you.\n I was expecting some dramatic turn-away,\n But you stayed.\n \n This morning I said we should talk about it.\n 'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved.\n That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said, \"Okay, let's talk.\"\n \n And I said,\n Stay, stay, stay.\n I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.\n You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.\n But I think that it's best if we both stay.\n \n Before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers,\n Who took all of their problems out on me.\n But you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughin'.\n And I love you because you have given me no choice but to...\n \n Stay, stay, stay.\n I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.\n You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.\n But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay.\n \n You took the time to memorize me:\n My fears, my hopes, and dreams.\n I just like hangin' out with you all the time.\n All those times that you didn't leave;\n It's been occurring to me I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life.\n \n Stay.\n And I'll be loving you for quite some time.\n No one else is gonna love me, when I get mad, mad, mad.\n So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.\n \n Stay, stay, stay.\n I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.\n You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.\n But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.\n \n Stay, stay, stay.\n I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.\n You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.\n But I think that it's best if we both stay.\n \n [Background:] That's so fun![Gary Lightbody:]\n I find myself at your door,\n Just like all those times before,\n I'm not sure how I got there,\n All roadsthey lead me

just the other day,\n While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away.\n Back to a first-glance feeling on New York Time.\n Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme.\n Took off faster than a green light \"Go\".\n Yeah, you skipped the conversation when you already know.\n I left a note on the door with a joke wed made,\n And that was the first day.\n \n And darling, it was good never looking down.\n And right there where we stood was holy ground.\n \n Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress,\n We had this big wide city all to ourselves.\n We blocked the noise with the sound of I need you,\n And for the first time I had something to lose,\n And I guess we fell apart in the usual way.\n And the storys got dust on every page,\n But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now.\n And I see your face in every crowd.\n \n Cause darling, it was good never looking down.\n And right there where we stood was holy ground.\n \n Tonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through.\n But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you.\n Tonight Im gonna dance like you were in this room.\n But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you,\n \n It was good never looking down.\n And right there where we stood was holy ground.\n \n Tonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through.\n But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you.\n Tonight Im gonna dance like you were in this room.\n But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you.Long handwritten note deep in your pocket\n Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late\n I stood

meet you in warm conversation\n We both wake in lonely beds in different cities\n And time is taking its sweet time erasing you\n And you've got your demons, and, darling, they all look like me\n \n 'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there\n What a sad beautiful tragic love affair\n \n Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting\n Silence, this train runs off its tracks\n Kiss me, try to fix it,

place.\n \n Another name goes up in lights. You wonder if youll make it out alive.\n \n And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.\n Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.\n Can you tell me now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.\n \n

land somewhere,\n Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square,\n And it took some time, but I understand it now.\n \n Cause now my name is up in lights, but I think you got it right,\n \n Let me tell

never would forget how he moved.\n The whole place was dressed to the nines,\n And we were dancing, dancing\n Like we're made of starlight\n Like we're made of starlight\n \n I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45\n Picked me up late one night out the window,\n We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild\n Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in\n The night we snuck into a yacht club party\n Pretending to be a duchess and a prince\n \n And I said, \"Oh my, what a marvelous tune.\"\n It was the best night, never would forget how he moved.\n The whole place was dressed to the nines,\n And we were dancing, dancing\n Like we're made of starlight, starlight\n Like we're made of starlight, starlight\n \n He said, \"Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change.\n You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way.\"\n He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me,\n \"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?\n Don't you dream impossible things?\"\n \n Like \"Oh my, what a marvelous tune.\"\n It was the best night, never would forget how he moved\n The whole place was dressed to the nines,\n And we were dancing, dancing\n Like we're made of starlight, starlight\n Like we're made of starlight, starlight\n \n Ooh ooh he's talking crazy\n Ooh ooh dancing with me\n Ooh ooh we could get married\n Have ten kids and teach them how to dream\n \n Oh my, what a marvelous tune\n It was the best night, never would forget how he moved\n The whole place was dressed to the nines,\n And we were dancing, dancing\n Like we're made of starlight, starlight\n Like we're made of starlight, starlight\n Like we're made of starlight, starlight\n Like we dream impossible dreams\n Like starlight, starlight\n Like we dream impossible dreams\n Don't you see the starlight, starlight?\n Don't you dream impossible things?Took a deep breath in the mirror\n He didn't like it when I wore high heels\n But I do\n Turn the lock and put my headphones on\n He always said he didn't get this song\n But I do, I do\n \n Walked in expecting you'd be late\n But you got here early and you stand and wave\n I walk to you\n You pull my chair out and help me in\n And you don't know how nice that is\n But I do\n \n And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid\n I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did\n I've been spending the last eight months\n Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end\n But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again\n \n You said you never met one girl\n Who had as many James Taylor records as you\n But I do\n We tell stories and you don't know why\n I'm coming off a little shy\n But I do\n \n But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid\n I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did\n \n I've been spending the last eight months\n Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end\n But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again\n \n And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up\n But you start to talk about the movies that your family\n Watches\n Every single Christmas and I want to talk about that\n And for the first time what's past is past\n \n 'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid\n I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did\n I've been spending the last eight months\n \n Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end\n But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again\n \n But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin againYou should've been there,\n Should've burst through the door,\n With that 'baby I'm right here' smile,\n And it would've felt like,\n A million little shining stars had just aligned,\n And I would've been so happy.\n \n Christmas lights glisten,\n I've got my eye on the door,\n Just waiting for you to walk in,\n But the time is ticking,\n People ask me how I've been\n As I comb back through my memory,\n How you said you'd be here,\n You said you'd be here.\n \n And it was like slow motion,\n Standing there in my party dress,\n In red lipstick,\n With no one to impress,\n And they're all laughing,\n As I'm looking around the room,\n But there's one thing missing,\n And that was the moment I knew.\n \n And the hours pass by,\n Now I just wanna be alone,\n But your close friends always seem to know\n When there's something really wrong,\n So they follow me down the hall,\n And there in the bathroom,\n I try not to fall apart,\n And the sinking feeling starts,\n As I say hopelessly,\n \"He said he'd be here.\"\n \n And it was like slow motion,\n Standing there in my party dress,\n In red lipstick,\n With no one to impress,\n And they're all laughing,\n And asking me about you,\n But there was one thing missing,\n And that was the moment I knew.\n \n What do you say\n When tears are streaming down your face\n In front of everyone you know?\n And what do you do when the one\n Who means the most to you\n Is the one who didn't show?\n \n You should've been here.\n And I would've been so happy.\n \n And it was like slow motion,\n Standing there in my party dress,\n In red lipstick,\n With no one to impress,\n And they're all standing around me singing\n \"Happy birthday to you\",\n But there was one thing missing,\n And that was the moment I knew.\n \n Ooh, I knew.\n Ooh,\n \n You called me later,\n And said, \"I'm sorry, I didn't make it,\"\n And I said, \"I'm sorry too,\"\n And that was the moment I knew.You said it in a simple way,\n 4 AM, the second day,\n How strange that I don't know you at all.\n Stumbled through the long goodbye,\n One last kiss, then catch your flight,\n Right when I was just about to fall\n \n I told myself, \"Don't get attached,\"\n But in my mind I play it back,\n Spinning faster than the plane that took you...\n \n And this is when the feeling sinks in,\n I don't wanna miss you like this,\n Come back... be here, come back... be here.\n I guess you're in New York today,\n I don't wanna need you this way,\n Come back... be here, come back... be here.\n \n The delicate beginning rush,\n The feeling you can know so much,\n Without knowing anything at all.\n And now that I can't put this down,\n If I had known what I'd known now,\n I never would have played so nonchalant.\n \n Taxi cabs and busy streets,\n That never bring you back to me,\n I can't help but wish you took me with you...\n \n And this is when the feeling sinks in,\n I don't wanna miss you like this,\n Come back... be here, come back... be here.\n I guess you're in London today,\n I don't wanna need you this way,\n Come back... be here, come back... be here.\n \n This is falling in love in the cruelest way,\n This is falling for you when you are worlds away.\n \n New York... be here.\n But you're in London and I break down,\n 'Cause it's not fair that you're not around.\n \n This is when the feeling sinks in,\n I don't wanna miss you like this,\n Come back... be here, come back... be here.\n I guess you're in New York today,\n And I don't wanna need you this way,\n Come back... be here, come back... be here.\n \n I don't wanna miss you like this.\n Come back... be here.\n Come back... be here.Don't look at me,\n You've got a girl at home,\n And everybody knows that,\n Everybody knows that,\n Uh, uh\n Don't look at me,\n You've got a girl at home,\n And everybody knows that.\n \n I don't even know her,\n But I feel a responsibility,\n To do what's upstanding and right,\n It's kinda like a code, yeah,\n And you've been getting closer and closer,\n And crossing so many lines.\n \n And it would be a fine proposition,\n If I was a stupid girl,\n But honey I am no-one's exception,\n This I have previously learned.\n \n So don't look at me,\n You've got a girl at home,\n And everybody knows that,\n Everybody knows that,\n Uh, uh\n Don't look at me,\n You've got a girl at home,\n And everybody knows

that.\n \n I just wanna make sure,\n You understand perfectly,\n You're the kind of man who makes me sad,\n While she waits up,\n You chase down the newest thing,\n And take for granted what you have.\n \n And it would be a fine proposition,\n If I was a stupid girl,\n And yeah I might go with it,\n If I hadn't once been just like her.\n \n Don't look at me,\n You've got a girl at home,\n And everybody knows that,\n Everybody knows that,\n Uh, uh\n Don't look at me,\n You've got a girl at home,\n And everybody knows that,\n Everybody knows that,\n I see you turn off your phone,\n And now you've got me alone,\n And I say,\n Don't look at me,\n You've got a girl at home,\n And everybody knows that,\n Everybody knows that.\n \n Call a cab,\n Lose my number,\n You're about to lose your girl,\n Call a cab,\n Lose my number,\n Let's consider this lesson learned.\n \n Don't look at me,\n You've got a girl at home,\n And everybody knows that,\n Everybody knows that,\n Uh, uh\n Don't look at me,\n You've got a girl at home,\n And everybody knows that,\n Everybody knows that,\n Wanna see you pick up your phone,\n And tell her you're coming home,\n Don't look at me,\n You've got a girl at home,\n And everybody knows that,\n Everybody knows that,\n Uh, uh\n Don't look at me,\n You've got a girl at home,\n And everybody knows that,\n Everybody knows that.\n \n It would be a fine

seems so simple\n We were lying on your couch\n I remember\n You took a Polaroid of us\n Then discovered (then discovered)\n The rest of the world was black and white\n But we were in screaming color\n And I remember thinking\n \n [Chorus 2x:]\n Are we out of the woods yet?\n Are we out of the woods yet?\n Are we out of the woods yet?\n Are we out of the woods?\n Are we in the clear yet?\n Are we in the clear yet?\n Are we in the clear yet?\n In the clear yet?\n Good\n \n Are we out of the woods?\n \n Looking at it now\n Last December (last December)\n We were built to fall apart\n Then fall back together (back together)\n Your necklace hanging from my neck\n The night we couldn't quite forget\n When we decided (we decided)\n To move the furniture so we could dance,\n Baby, like we stood a chance\n Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying\n And I remember thinkin'\n \n [Chorus 2x]\n \n (Are we out of the woods?!)\n \n Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?\n Twenty stitches in the hospital room\n When you started cryin', baby, I did, too\n But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you\n Remember when we couldn't take the heat\n I walked out and said, \"I'm settin' you free,\"\n But the monsters turned out to be just trees\n And when the sun came up, you were lookin' at me\n You were lookin' at me\n You were lookin' at me,\n I remember, oh, I remember\n \n [Chorus 4x]People like you always want back the love they gave away\n And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed\n The more I think about it now the less I know\n All I know is that you drove us off the road\n \n Stay\n Hey, all you had to do was stay\n Had me in the palm of your hand\n Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in\n Stay, hey, now you say you want it\n Back now that it's just too late\n Well, it could've been easy\n All you had to do was stay\n \n All you had to do was stay\n All you had to do was stay\n All you had to do was stay\n All you had to do was stay\n \n Here you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say\n I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made\n People like you always want back the love they pushed aside\n But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye\n \n Stay\n Hey, all you had to do was stay\n Had me in the palm of your hand\n Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in\n Stay, hey, now you say you want it\n Back now that it's just too late\n Well, it could've been easy\n All you had to do was stay\n \n All you had to do was stay\n All you had to do was stay\n All you had to do was stay\n \n Let me remind\n You this was what you wanted\n You ended it\n You were all I wanted\n But not like this\n Not like this\n Not like this\n Oh, all you had to do was stay\n \n Hey, all you had to do was stay\n Had me in the palm of your hand\n Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in\n Stay, hey, now you say you want it\n Back now that it's just too late\n Well, it could've been easy\n All you had to do was stay\n \n Hey, all you had to do was stay\n Had me in the palm of your hand\n Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in\n Stay, hey, now you say you want it\n Back now that it's just too late\n Well, it could've been easy\n All you had to do was stay\n \n All you had to do was stay\n All you had to do was stay\n All you had to do was stay\n All you had to do was stayI stay out too late\n Got nothing in my brain\n That's what people say, mmm-mmm\n That's what people say, mmm-mmm\n \n I go on too many dates [chuckle]\n But I can't make them stay\n At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm\n That's what people say, mmm-mmm\n \n But I keep cruising\n Can't stop, won't stop moving\n It's like I got this

Sunday\n You keep his shirt\n He keeps his word\n And for once you let go\n Of your fears and your ghosts\n One step, not much\n But it said enough\n You kiss on sidewalks\n You fight and you talk\n One night he wakes\n Strange look on his face\n Pauses, then says\n You're my best friend\n And you knew what it was\n He is in love\n \n You can hear it in the silence, silence\n You can feel it on the way home, way home\n You can see it with the lights out, lights out\n You are in love, true love\n \n And so it goes\n You two are dancing in a snow globe round and round\n And he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown\n And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars\n And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words\n \n 'Cause you can hear it

very start\n The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart\n \n Will my love come in a bowl of fire?\n Will it be filled with hope and desire?\n Will my love come in a pouring rain?\n Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain\n Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love\n \n I know I'm not a little girl anymore\n Cause I'm feeling things I've never felt before\n Sweet sensations and anticipations\n Calling commotion to my emotions\n And I hear the words my daddy said to me\n He said be true 2 yourself & keep your spirit free\n And love will find you one way or another\n Be good to yourself and be good to each other\n \n Will my love come in a bowl of fire?\n Will it be filled with hope and desire?\n Will my love come in a pouring rain?\n Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain\n Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love\n \n It's a run around the world\n And it's moving so fast\n Though I wanna find\n A love that's gonna last\n A love so strong\n That I can withstand\n The weight of the world\n In the palm of its hand\n \n Will my love come in a bowl of fire?\n Will it be filled with hope and desire?\n Will my love come in a pouring rain?\n Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain\n Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for this game\n Am I ready for the kiss, am I ready for the stars\n Am I ready for the bliss, am I ready for loveAmerican boy,

Somewhere else\n \n After all it was a great big world\n With lots of places to run to\n And if she had to die trying\n She had one little promise she was gonna keep\n \n Oh yeah, all right\n Take it

the street in a broken down house\n And a car up on blocks in the driveway\n The moment we meet, there was never a doubt\n That we won't forget this Sunday\n It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles\n And it all leads to this - our first kiss\n \n All my friends are saying \n Girl, what are you thinking?\n You're better off, \n you're better off without him\n Find yourself another\n Girl, that boy is trouble\n You're better off, you're better off\n They can talk forever, they just don't know better\n \n We drive around town in a rusty old truck\n Somehow it feels like we're flying\n Don't wanna come down\n But they make it so tough\n 'Cause everyone we know is trying\n To push us apart hide it down in our hearts\n And they get what they want cause you're gone\n \n All my friends

you'd want to know\n \n That when you feel the world is crashing\n All around your feet\n Come running headlong into my arms\n Breathless\n I'll never judge you\n I can only love you\n Come now running headlong\n Into my arms\n Breathless\n \n Lay down your guns\n Too weak to run\n Nothing can harm you here\n Your precious heart\n Broken and scarred\n Somehow you made it through\n I only ask that you won't go again\n \n When you feel the world is crashing\n All around your feet\n Come running headlong into my arms\n Breathless\n I'll never judge you\n I can only love you\n Come now running headlong\n Into my arms\n Breathless\n \n I'm so glad to see you smiling\n So good to hear your laugh\n I think that you've found you even\n Missed yourself\n I'm only asking this because I think that\n Truth be told\n Oh, you'll never go again\n Again\n \n When you feel the world is crashing\n All around your feet\n Come running headlong into my arms\n Breathless\n I'll never judge you\n I can only love you\n Come now running headlong\n Into my arms\n Breathless\n BreathlessEmily comes home from school,\n Grabs onto her daddy's hand,\n He says, \"Baby girl, what's wrong with you?\"\n She says, \"Please, don't make me go back there again.\"\n \n She said, \"I wish there was some way\n To make them stop it.\"\n So he drives down to\n That principles office and says,\n \n \"I didn't bring her up\n So they could cut her down.\n I didn't bring her here\n So they could shut her out.\n I live my whole damn life\n To see that little girl's smile.\n So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?\n She wasn't brought up that way.\"\n \n Emily's home late again\n He sees that boy drive away\n Oh, but something's different this time,\n She doesn't have too much to say\n She said, \"He tried but there's just some things I won't do.\"\n And through the tears she said, \"I couldn't do that to you.\"\n And he said,\n \n \"I didn't bring you up\n So he could wear you down.\n Take that innocent heart\n And turn it inside out.\n I live my whole damn life\n To see my little girl's smile.\n So don't let nobody take that away.\n You weren't brought up that way.\"\n \n The phone rings on a rainy night\n Says, \"It's officer Tate.\"\n He said, \"Sir, there's been an accident.\n You better come down here right away.\n A drunken driver missed an over pass.\n And Emily  she's fading fast.\"\n \n He says, \"God, I didn't bring her up\n To watch them lay her down.\n Nearly killed me the day\n They put her momma in the ground.\n Only thing that kept me alive\n Was that little girl's smile.\n So please don't take that away.\n It won't be easy taking her today.\n She wasn't brought up that way.\"\n \n He stands over the hospital bed\n Emily opens her eyesI had to catch my breath\n When I saw you there across the room\n Holding her hand\n I'd have never guessed\n That starting over would look so good on you\n But here I am\n Still believing there might come a day\n We'll pick up where we left off\n \n And by the way\n Your eyes are dancing\n I'd say the chances of that are getting slim\n By the way\n My heart's still breaking\n It's gonna take it a while to love again\n So many things that I forgot to say\n By the way\n \n I should've let you know\n All the ways you made me feel alive\n I guess it's too late\n So I'll just get my coat\n And make my way into this breezy night\n Give you one last wave\n Maybe you'll drop what you're doing\n And come over here to say \n I'm looking good\n \n But by the way\n Your eyes are dancing\n I'd say the chances of that are getting slim\n By the way\n My heart's still breaking\n It's gonna take it a while to love again\n So many things that I forgot to say\n \n By the way\n You still look amazing\n And I must've been crazy to let you get away\n By the way\n If you ever wondered\n Still got the same old number; just in case\n I still miss you\n And i still love you\n By the way\n By the way, ohAny day now, they're talking war\n I can see the look that's in your eyes\n They're not talking a week or two\n Oh, daddy can I go with you?\n Oh, daddy can I go with you?\n \n You pack a suitcase, take a picture from the wall\n I always knew this time would come\n When I ask how long you think you're gonna be\n You say, this crazy world's come undone\n \n Summer's over and leaves begin to fall\n And another winter's on the way\n I knew I wasn't gonna take this very well\n But I'd give anything to have you here today\n \n Everyday now they're talking war\n & I know this time is like it's never been before\n We're not talking about a week or two\n \n Oh, daddy can I go with you?\n Oh, daddy can I go with you?\n Oh, daddy can I go with you?I drive around this town\n In a Mustang with the top down\n And six running horses under my hood\n Well thats good enough for me\n Dont need the real thing\n Thats just another thing \n For me to try to tame\n Dont know if I could\n It might just break me\n I thought there for a little while\n Every sunset Id be a riding off with him\n \n Snap buttons on a denim shirt\n Blue jeans and a little dirt\n Thats the closest youll see me\n Feet hanging out a pickup truck\n Crazy and a little rough\n Running free\n Thats the closest to a cowboy\n Youll see me\n \n Before I met him \n I was so sane and grounded\n Before he taught me how to lie\n And crawl out the window\n I learned the dirt roads\n And I got my heart broken\n Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry\n And how to let go\n I thought there for a little while\n Every sunset Id be a riding off with him\n \n Snap buttons on a denim shirt\n Blue jeans and a little dirt\n Thats the closest youll see me\n Feet hanging out a pickup truck\n Crazy and a little rough\n Running free\n Thats the closest to a cowboy\n Youll see me\n \n It was all a little\n Wonderful and strange\n But Ill never look\n At a sunset the same night\n \n Snap buttons on a denim shirt\n Blue jeans and a little dirt\n Thats the closest youll see me\n Feet hanging out a pickup truck\n Crazy and a little rough\n Running free\n Sitting fishing by the river bank\n Swimming in the water tank\n Thats the closest youll see me\n Feet hanging out a pickup truck\n Crazy and a little rough\n Running free\n Thats the closest to a cowboy\n Youll see meI'd never gone with the wind\n Just let it flow\n Let it take me where it wants to go\n 'Til you open the door\n There's so much more\n I'd never seen it before\n I was trying to fly\n But I couldn't find wings\n But you came along and you changed everything\n \n [Chorus:]\n You lift my feet off the ground\n You spin me around\n You make me crazier, crazier\n Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes\n You make me crazier, crazier, crazier\n \n I've watched from a distance as you made life your own\n Every sky was your own kind of blue\n And I wanted to know how that would feel\n And you made it so real\n You showed me something that I couldn't see\n You opened my eyes\n And you made me believe\n \n [Chorus]\n \n Baby you showed me what living is for\n I don't wanna hide anymore\n Oh oh\n \n You lift my feet off the ground\n You spin me around\n You make me crazier, crazier\n Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes\n You make me crazier, crazier, crazier\n Crazier, crazier.Ive been counting days and\n

with.\"\n He hangs up the phone and she whispers back,\n \n Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow\n Won't you come back to me?\n I'll be here, today and here tomorrow\n In dark blue Tennessee\n \n He was lying when he said he moved to L.A.\n He's just hiding out on the other side of town\n With his head in his hands and she's just 7 miles away\n He's staring out the window and puts her picture down saying,\n \n Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow\n Won't you come back to me?\n I'll be here, today and here tomorrow\n In dark blue Tennessee\n \n She almost called him on the night that he wrote\n These simple words on his goodbye note\n \n Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow\n Won't you come back to me?\n I'll be here, today and here tomorrow\n In dark blue Tennessee\n \n In dark blue TennesseeShe walks to school with her arms crossed\n It's just another day\n At 10 o'clock she hears this screaming\n Then finally she sees them\n It's scary how things change\n \n And I saw the story on the news\n I saw the footage from the roof\n I sat down and cried\n \n Didn't she call you?\n Didn't she need you bad enough?\n Was there some reason I'm not aware of?\n Did you not write it down\n Just one more thing to do\n Where were you\n And didn't she pray too\n \n He kissed his wife good bye\n And took the earliest flight\n So he could be home that night\n To put his kids to sleep\n Down the aisle three men walked and said,\n \"We're here to die for our God.\"\n He stood up and said, \"That's funny,\n 'Cause my God died for me.\"\n \n I put the magazine down\n I read his words out loud\n I sat down and cried\n \n Didn't he call you?\n Didn't he need you bad enough?\n Was there some reason I'm not aware of?\n Did you not write it down?\n Just one more thing to do\n Where were you?\n And didn't he pray too?\n \n The taxis pulled up on the very day of\n They rode 100 floors up just to come back down\n They never thought they'd see the day\n That the towers up in flames\n There was nothing left to say when it all came down\n \n And didn't they call you?\n Didn't they need you bad enough?\n Was there some reason I'm not aware of?\n Did you not write it down?\n Just one more thing to do\n Where were you? Where were you?\n And didn't they pray too?\n \n I walk to school and I wear a cross\n I'm counting every dayMy momma stood across the room\n Face to face but never eye to eye\n Recalling words we said\n The battle that we swore\n We'd never fight\n Breaking pieces off with every lie\n A tear came to her eye\n And she said\n \n Don't walk away now\n And don't rip my heart out\n Don't you block me out tonight\n Honey where are you?\n And don't hate me for loving you\n \n He walked around my life\n And made blind\n With every single move\n He caught me staring at him\n Mad about him\n Little that I knew \n Love is different\n When you play the fool\n And all I wanna do is say\n \n Don't walk away now\n And don't rip my heart out\n Don't you make cry tonight\n Like you always do\n And don't hate me for loving you\n \n I slammed the door\n Sat on the floor\n Cried into my bed\n Said are you there?\n Do you even care?\n To cross above my head\n But someone said\n \n Don't turn away now\n And don't rip my heart out\n Things are meant to happen like this\n I know it's right for you\n And don't hate me for loving you\n \n I looked up at the sky\n Face to face and finally\n Eye to eyeHere in my mind the sky looks the same\n On every day you loved me \n When we started home it started to rain \n You put your coat around me \n We stood there in the road \n You held me so close \n But did you ever let go \n \n Down came the rain \n Lightning and thunder \n We tried in vain \n To hold on to each other \n Winds of change blew you away from me \n Right here right now, I feel it on my skin \n The bitter sting of what we couldve been \n Just when our love was like a burning flame \n Down came the rain \n \n In through the window I see her with you \n Im soaked to the skin, youre

Has ever looked this good to me\n He tells me about his night\n And I count the colors in his eyes\n Hell never fall in love he swears\n As he runs his fingers through his hair\n Im laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong\n And I don't think it ever crossed his mind\n He tells a joke, I fake a smile\n But I know all his favorite songs\n And...\n \n [Chorus:]\n I could tell you his favorite color's green\n He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth\n His sister's beautiful, he has his fathers eyes\n And if you asked me if I love him,\n Id lie\n \n He looks around the room\n Innocently overlooks the truth\n Shouldnt a light go on?\n Doesnt he know that Ive had him memorized for so long?\n He sees everything black and white\n Never let nobody see him cry\n I dont let nobody see me wishing he was mine\n \n [Chorus]\n \n He stands there, then walks away\n My god if I could only say,\n \"Im holding every breath for you...\"\n \n Hed never tell you but he can play guitar\n I think he can see through everything but my heart\n First thought when I wake up\n Is \"My god, hes beautiful.\"\n So I put on my make-up\n And pray for a miracle\n \n Yes, I could tell you his favorite color's green\n He loves to argue, oh, and it kills me\n His sister's beautiful, he has his fathers eyes\n And if you asked me if I love him\n If you asked me if I love him\n Id lieShe didn't have a reason to go, oh

bound\n But I understand it somehow\n \n If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?\n Would it be a million miles of cold white lies\n And unfamiliar exit signs?\n I just drive on by, just south of knowing why\n \n I didn't really know her that well\n But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind\n She felt so out of touch, cos she just felt too much\n If you don't know what you want nothing's ever enough\n \n And time stands still when you're nowhere bound\n That's where I'm headed right now\n \n If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?\n

going back\n I don't have a when and I don't have a where\n I don't even know if I'll know when I'm there\n \n But If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?\n Would it be a million miles of cold white lies\n And unfamiliar exit signs?\n I just drive on by\n \n I just drive on by, drive on, drive on\n Drive all night\n If I drive on, drive on, drive on\n Drive all night, just

exit sign\n I was talking crazy\n On the drivers side\n And I know I hurt you\n But I can't confess\n Was that blood or a wine stain\n On your wedding dress\n \n Going back to Nashville\n Thinking 'bout the whole thing\n Guess you gotta run sometimes\n Maybe I'm a fast train\n Blowing through a mountain\n Watching all my life go by\n \n Going back to Nashville\n Laughing at a bad break\n What's the use of wondering why?\n Maybe I'm a storm front\n Blowing through a valley\n Tearing up a good July\n \n And its safe and warm\n Where nothing ever happens\n Could it be so hard\n To realign a star or two\n Change a southern night for you\n \n Going back to Nashville\n Thinking bout the whole thing\n Guess you gotta run sometimes\n Maybe I'm a fast train\n Blowing though a valley\n Tearing

west bound train\n See how far I can go\n Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain\n And talk to someone I don't know\n I will face the world around me\n Knowing that I'm strong enough to

had our own secret club\n I remember you dancing before bed time\n Then jumping on me, waking me up\n \n I can still feel you hold my hand, little man\n And even the moment I knew\n You fought it hard like an army guy\n Remember I leaned in and whispered to you\n \n Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here\n You were my best four years\n \n I remember the drive home\n When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming \"Why?\"\n Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say\n About a beautiful boy who died\n \n And it's about to be Halloween\n You could be anything you wanted if you were still here\n I remember the last day when I kissed your face\n And whispered in your ear\n \n Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here\n Out of this curtained room in this hospital grey, we'll just disappear\n Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here\n You were my best four years\n \n What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?\n What if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?\n And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?\n What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?\n \n Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here\n Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here\n You were my best four years\n \n I remember your bare feet down the hallway\n I love you to the moon and

you dare look out your window darling\n Everything's on fire\n The war outside our door keeps raging on\n Hold onto this lullaby\n Even when the music's gone\n Gone\n \n Just close your eyes\n The sun is going down\n You'll be alright\n No one can hurt you now\n Come morning light\n You and I'll be safe and sound\n \n Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh\n La La (La La)\n La La (La La)\n Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh\n

the sand\n I wonder\n If a broken heart\n Feel the warmth\n On my hand\n And I wonder\n What a piece\n Of driftwood\n Has seen all through\n His lifetime\n Let's walk away\n The past through\n The smokey black nights\n \n I've seen\n A million things\n Spoke a million words\n Now I only want\n To speak to you\n \n Waiting for the words\n Counting every bird\n There's nothing\n I'd rather do\n On the\n Smokey black nights\n \n Still throught\n The haze\n I can make out\n Constellations\n I'll make one\n Of you and me\n As we sit\n In the sand\n And I saw\n That sunset gleamin\n As my eyes went wild\n Let's walk away\n The past through\n The smokey black nights\n \n I've played\n A thousand songs\n Sang a thousand words\n Now I only want\n To sing to you\n \n Waited on a wire\n Starin' at the fire\n There's nothing\n I'd rather do\n On the\n Smokey black nights\n \n I've walked\n A thousand miles\n Smiled\n A thousand smiles\n Now I only smile\n When I'm with you\n \n Waiting for the words\n Counting every bird\n There's nothing\n I'd rather do\n On the\n Smokey black nights\n \n So walk with me\n As the sweet\n Wind dances\n I'll write a song\n For you and me\n On the\n Smokey black nightsDays go by, I wonder if you here me\n Can't you read between the lines?\n Now I'm standing still, I am disappearing \n Take this chance, I'll make you mine\n \n Don't you wonder why\n You change in time\n Makes you feel so empty inside\n \n But love's got me cornered in the back of the room\n I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around\n And all I see is someone I don't know\n Love's got me tangled, tired me too\n No sign of a wall, sign of wall,\n Spinning me around\n And baby all I see is you\n \n He tells lies, are you really thinking\n That you deserve another try\n When you see these eyes\n You see another planet\n Don't ask how, but fate decides\n \n Don't you wonder why\n You change in time\n Makes you feel so empty inside\n \n But love's got me cornered in the back of the room\n I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around\n And all I see is someone I don't know\n Love's got me tangled, tired me too\n No sign of a wall, sign of wall,\n Spinning me around\n And baby all I see is you\n \n Spinning and turning\n And living and learning\n I should be able to handle this\n Make it or break it\n Move it or shake it\n Do it or fake it\n Girl you've got to make it\n \n But love's got me cornered in the back of the room\n I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around\n And all I see is someone I don't know\n Love's got me tangled, tired me too\n No sign of a wall, sign of wall,\n Spinning me around\n And baby all I see is you\n \n Spinning me around\n And baby all I see is you\n \n Spinning me around\n And all I see is youLet me know, how's it feel\n To be under my skin, wrapped around my heart\n Is it like anywhere you've been?\n And everything I do, I do it just for you\n So why the hell don't you love me?\n Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?\n Are you so far above me?\n Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?\n But I was just a toy, which you destroyed\n Stupid boy\n \n I have been looking in, trying to read your mind\n Give you the benefit of the doubt, every single time\n And then you walk right by, I'm screaming out inside\n Why the hell don't you love me?\n Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?\n Are you so far above me?\n Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?\n But I was just a toy, which you destroyed\n Stupid boy\n \n What happens when you wake up, to see that you've lost?\n You take one look at me, 'cause that's what it cost.\n I was gonna be everything you need\n 'Cause you're everything to me\n \n So why the hell don't you love me?\n Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?\n Are you so far above me?\n Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?\n But I was just a toy, which you destroyed\n Stupid boy\n \n Let me know, how's it feel to be under my skinTire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze\n Whistle County creek\n Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass\n Baby, you were watching me\n Cold barn struck bed, everything you said\n Slowly educating me\n I never had a lesson so sweet\n \n You can get high on a first kiss\n You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces\n You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner\n Nothing's shatterproof\n You can crash and burn and come back someone new\n And that's what I learned from you\n \n Autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change\n Just like the two of us\n Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket\n Guess I loved you way too much\n But I'm a little smarter, my heart's a little harder\n But it's still soft enough to cry\n Cause I remember those times\n \n I remember.........\n \n You can get high on a first kiss\n You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces\n You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner\n Nothing's

of true love\n Should have all worked out\n But it didn't\n She should be here now\n But she isn't\n \n [Chorus:]\n There's your trouble, \n There's your trouble\n You keep seeing double\n With the wrong one\n You can't see I love you, \n You can't see she doesn't\n But you just keep holding on\n There's your trouble\n \n So now you're thinking 'bout\n All you're missing how\n Deep you're sinking, \n Round and round and dragging down\n Why don't you cash in your chips\n Why don't you call it a loss\n Not such a big loss, \n Chalk it up better luck\n Could have been true love\n But it wasn't\n It should all add up\n But it doesn't\n \n [Repeat chorus]\n \n Should have all worked out\n But it didn't\n She should be here now\n But she isn't\n \n [Repeat chorus]Stumble up the porch step\n You sat down in the car\n Only thirteen blocks across this town\n To get to where you are\n And that dont offer me much time\n To make up my mind\n So I best be driving slow\n On my way to letting go\n \n These headlights they just wanna fade\n Off into the night\n But if theyre half as stubborn as me\n Theyll just keep on shining bright\n I aint ever been one to settle like\n The dust does on the dash\n Since the feeling aint strong\n Ill just move on\n And leave this in my past\n \n Once you're gone I know your memory'll\n Somehow get the best of me\n So I question everything I do\n Unsure of turning you away\n Wondering love how Ill act today\n Until you find somebody new\n So Ive been holding on\n Way too long\n But not another minute\n I'm gonna miss you bad but\n Cant call it love if you aint in it\n \n Red light turns to green\n Then back to red again\n I wish there were some other travelers out here\n To slow my travelling\n Even though the wheel rolled on\n Inside I still dont know\n Oh and it troubles me so\n \n Once you're gone I know your memory'll\n Somehow get the best of me\n So I question everything I do\n Unsure of turning you away\n Wondering love how Ill feel today\n I see you found somebody new\n And Ive been holding on\n Way too long\n But not another minute\n I might miss you bad but\n Cant call it love if you aint in it\n \n Once

been holding on\n Way too long\n But not another minute\n I might miss you bad but\n Cant call it love if you aint in it\n \n Your car comes to a rest in the drive\n You open up the door and I see you smileWalking downtown shuffling my feet\n I try to dream my dreams above the concrete\n Store windows, traveled for miles\n But something I passed really caught my eye\n It was cracked down the middle, permanent scars\n But I fell in love with this here guitar\n \n Nice to meet you, can I teach you\n All I know, can you show me what you do\n Where have you been\n What have you seen\n Who

got her magic\n Floating through the air\n \n Peace, love\n One thing leads into another\n Dream big, aim small\n Man you gotta love her\n She's got her hopes up\n Got 'em up to there\n Wondering what to wear\n \n She's standing in her bedroom\n He'll be pulling up soon\n She thinks about it when she sees headlights\n Looking out the window\n She's got her diary to show\n That she's been waiting for this all her life\n \n First date, can't wait\n Looking in the mirror\n Heart all wrapped up\n Wait until he sees her\n He's looking right at her\n She thinks about it\n \n Sixteen blue jeans, Abercrombie T-shirt\n Shoes, purse, hair tied back\n And you should see her\n She's got her magic\n Floating through the air\n \n Peace, love\n One thing leads into another\n Dream big, aim small\n Man you gotta love her\n She's got her hopes up\n Got 'em up to there\n Wondering what to wear\n \n The years went by\n The mirror saw her cry\n She got up again\n She got up again\n The wind blew by\n The small town lights\n She got up again\n \n Move out, find out\n Where the world can take her\n Bright lights, late nights\n Living for the greater\n Move to Paris\n Living on a prayer\n \n Peace, love\n One thing leads into another\n Dream big, aim small\n Man you gotta love her\n She's got her hopes up\n Got 'em up to there\n She's got her hopes up\n Got 'em up to there\n Wondering what to wear\n \n Ohh, oh, oh\n Wondering what to wearYou walk in here with your guitar man\n Your shining boots and your full on band\n A smile on your face, a knife in your hand\n Singing songs you've got memorized\n With whatever talent money buys\n So polished that it slips right through your hands\n \n But don't ruin yourself I ain't your competition\n Don't flatter yourself that was never my intention\n \n I wanna talk about what you are that I ain't\n Let's talk about what you do that I can't\n Let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins\n Let's talk about what you did to get here\n Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears\n Let's talk about what you want to be and who I've always been\n \n I walk in here with a beat up case\n The same guitar I've always played\n And the words i wrote down on a page,\n When i was 12 years old a small town raised\n You tell the crowd you're paying dues,\n I tell them, \"this is what I do\"\n And its what i put my life into,\n As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume\n \n And say life on musical road is rough conditions\n But the easy ride was never my ambition\n \n I wanna talk about what you are that I ain't\n Let's talk about what you do that I can't\n Let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins\n Let's talk about what you did to get here\n Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears\n Let's talk about what you want to be and who I've always been\n \n Let's talk about your childhood days\n You were the prom queen, I was on this stage\n So where's that crown gotten you these days?\n When it's me and you and the same damn games\n \n So what have you got that I ain't?\n And what can you do that I can't?\n Let's put me and you in an empty room and see who wins\n Let's talk about what you did to get here\n Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears\n Let's talk about what you wanna be, girl, and who I've always beenI can't believe you did it again\n Walked by and took my heart with you\n Why did you have to look so good?\n Don't you know that I'm trying to hate you\n Trying to have a dream without you in it\n But how can I put out this fire\n When you're the one who lit it\n \n I can't wait for the day I stop pretending\n That I'm really ok when I'm not\n I want to know how it feels to be \n Over you for real \n Until I do\n I'll keep writing songs about you\n \n I've got a stack of papers so high\n And it's all about you baby\n Keep thinking maybe I\n Can make sense of something crazy\n Something I can't get out of my Head\n I write your name I write your name\n Then I tear it all to shreds\n \n I can't wait for the day I stop pretending\n That I'm really ok when I'm not\n I want to know how it feels to be \n Over you for real \n Until I do\n I'll keep writing songs about you\n \n And if you ever change your mind \n And want me back again\n I hope these songs will remind me\n Why I shouldn't let you in\n \n I can't wait for the day I stop pretending\n That I'm really ok cause I'm not\n I want to know how it feels to be \n Over you for real \n Until I do\n \n I'll just wait for the day\n I stop pretending\n That I'm really ok when I'm not\n I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real\n Till I do, \n I'll keep writing songs about youI bet you lie awake at night\n Trying to make up your sweet mind\n Wondering if you'll ever find\n Just what you want\n A home-town number one\n Or a California loaded gun\n But you know you only get one\n Or that's what you thought\n But here's what you've got\n \n [Chorus:]\n I could be your favorite blue jeans\n With the holes in the knees\n In the bottom of the top drawer\n I could be your little beauty queen\n Just a little outta reach\n Or the girl living next door\n I'll be your angel giving up her wings\n If that's what you need\n I'd give everything to be your anything\n \n If you want hard to get\n If you want...\n All you have to do is let me know\n If you want a bumpy ride\n Or someone with a softer side\n Either one'll be alright\n Just let me know\n Cause this is where it goes\n \n [Chorus]\n \n It's not like I'm giving up who I am for you\n but for someone like you it's just so easy to do\n \n I could be your favorite blue jeans\n With the holes in the knees\n In the bottom of the top drawer\n I could be your little beauty queen\n Just a little outta reach\n Or the girl living next door\n I'll be your angel giving up her wings\n If that's what you need\n \n If that's what you need\n \n [Chorus]I heard a song tonight on the radio\n Another girl sings about a boy\n Just sees his face in every space in every room\n And i know that if i turn around you won't be there\n If i close my eyes will you be there?\n \n I don't wanna lose your face\n And i don't wanna wake one day\n And not remember what time erased\n And i don't wanna turn around\n Coz i'm not scared\n Of what love gave me and took away\n And i don't wanna lose your face\n \n I've got a picture of you in my bedroom\n And i hope it never falls\n And i hope i never lose that feeling\n I used to get when you would call\n And now i wonder to myself\n Who were you and where are you?\n Were you ever here at all?\n \n I don't wanna lose your face\n And i don't wanna wake one day\n And not remember what time erased\n And i don't wanna turn around\n Coz i'm not scared\n Of what love gave me and took away\n And i don't wanna lose your face\n \n That girl in the song had it so good\n I wish i could close my eyes and see you\n I wish the sky had your face\n And the oceans had your eyes\n And the sunset had your lips\n And i had you\n \n I don't wanna lose your face\n And i don't wanna wake one day\n And not remember what time erased\n And i don't wanna turn around\n Coz i'm not scared\n Of what love gave me and took away\n And i don't wanna lose your face\n ",csv:'artist,album,track_title,track_n,lyric,line,year\n Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,He said the way my
